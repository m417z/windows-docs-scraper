# ExtRemoteData::ExtRemoteData(PCSTR,ULONG64,ULONG)

## Description

The **ExtRemoteData** constructor creates a new instance of the [ExtRemoteData](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nl-engextcpp-extremotedata) class.

## Parameters

### `Name` [in]

Name of the memory region. *Name* can be used to help identify the region and will be inserted into any error messages generated by the new object.

### `Offset` [in]

Location of the beginning of the memory region in the target's virtual address space.

### `Bytes` [in]

Number of bytes in the memory region.

## Remarks

If a memory region is specified, the contents of the region are read from the target and cached. The data can be retrieved using [ExtRemoteData::GetData](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nf-engextcpp-extremotedata-getdata) or one of the ExtRemoteTyped::Get*Xxx* methods.

The constructor is called by the ExtRemoteData::Set(Typed) and ExtRemoteData::Set(Offset Bytes) methods and the ExtRemoteData::GetData method.

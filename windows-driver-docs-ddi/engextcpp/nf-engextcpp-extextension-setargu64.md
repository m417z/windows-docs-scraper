# ExtExtension::SetArgU64

## Description

The **SetArgU64** method sets a named expression argument for the current expression command.

## Parameters

### `Name` [in]

Specifies the name of the argument. The command-line description used in [EXT_COMMAND](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/engextcpp/nf-engextcpp-ext_command) must specify that the type of this argument is expression.

### `Arg` [in]

Specifies the value of the named expression argument.

### `OnlyIfUnset` [in]

Specifies what happens if the argument is already set. If *OnlyIfUnset* is `true` and the argument has already been set, the argument will not be changed. If *OnlyIfUnset* is `false` and the argument has already been set, the argument will be changed.

## Return value

**SetArgU64** returns `true` if the argument was changed; `false` otherwise.

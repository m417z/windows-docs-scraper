# MINIPORT_WDI_CANCEL_IDLE_NOTIFICATION callback function

## Description

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This topic is part of the [WDI driver model](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/network/wdi-miniport-driver-design-guide) released in Windows 10. The WDI driver model is in maintenance mode and will only receive high priority fixes. [WiFiCx](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/netcx/wifi-wdf-class-extension-wificx) is the Wi-Fi driver model released in Windows 11. We recommend that you use WiFiCx to take advantage of the latest features.

NDIS calls the MiniportWdiCancelIdleNotification handler function to notify the WDI miniport driver that NDIS has detected activity on the suspended network adapter. Because of this, NDIS cancels the idle notification so that the network adapter can be transitioned to a full-power state.

This is a WDI miniport handler inside [NDIS_MINIPORT_DRIVER_WDI_CHARACTERISTICS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dot11wdi/ns-dot11wdi-_ndis_miniport_driver_wdi_characteristics).

**Note** You must declare the function by using the **MINIPORT_WDI_CANCEL_IDLE_NOTIFICATION** type. For more
information, see the following Examples section.

## Parameters

### `MiniportAdapterContext` [in]

The handle to the context area that the miniport driver allocated.

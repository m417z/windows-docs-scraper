# DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER structure

## Description

The **DXGKARG_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER** structure describes parameters for the [**DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer) callback that builds a paging buffer for use in a memory-transfer operation.

## Members

### `pDmaBuffer`

[in/out] A virtual address to the first available byte in the paging buffer. When the driver is first called with a new paging buffer, this virtual address is aligned on 4 KB. The driver tightly packs operations in the paging buffer until the paging buffer is full and then uses a new paging buffer. Therefore, if the graphics processing unit (GPU) requires a specific alignment for a paging-buffer submission, the driver should enforce this alignment by padding the operations that it writes to the paging buffer. Before the [**DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer) function returns, the driver should update **pDmaBuffer** to point past the last byte that is written to the paging buffer.

### `DmaSize`

[in/out] The size, in bytes, of the paging buffer that **pDmaBuffer** specifies.

### `pDmaBufferPrivateData`

[in/out] A pointer to a driver-resident private data structure that is associated with the direct memory access (DMA) buffer (that is, paging buffer) that **pDmaBuffer** specifies.

### `DmaBufferPrivateDataSize`

[in/out] The number of bytes that remain in the private data structure that **pDmaBufferPrivateData** points to for the current operation.

### `Operation`

[in] A [**DXGK_BUILDPAGINGBUFFER_OPERATION**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ne-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_buildpagingbuffer_operation)-typed value that indicates the type of memory operation to perform.

### `MultipassOffset`

[in/out] A UINT value that specifies the progress of the paging operation if multiple paging buffers are required. The driver sets this value to indicate a split into multiple paging buffers for more than one transfer operation. For example, the driver can store the page number that was last transferred for a paged-based transfer.

### `Transfer`

[in] A structure that describes the transfer operation.

### `Transfer.hAllocation`

[in] A handle to the allocation that the driver's [**DxgkDdiCreateAllocation**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_createallocation) function previously returned in the **hAllocation** member of a [**DXGK_ALLOCATIONINFO**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgk_allocationinfo) structure, which is part of the [**DXGKARG_CREATEALLOCATION**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/ns-d3dkmddi-_dxgkarg_createallocation) structure's **pAllocationInfo** member. The allocation handle points to a buffer that contains private driver data for the transfer.

### `Transfer.TransferOffset`

[in] The offset, in bytes, of the first page within the allocation that is transferred. This offset is applied only to a location that a segment location describes. This offset does not apply to an [**MDL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_mdl) description of a memory range. If the driver requires more than one paging buffer to complete the transfer (that is, the driver returns STATUS_GRAPHICS_INSUFFICIENT_DMA_BUFFER from its [**DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dkmddi/nc-d3dkmddi-dxgkddi_buildpagingbuffer) function), **TransferOffset** is the same for each call to **DxgkDdiBuildPagingBuffer** for this transfer.

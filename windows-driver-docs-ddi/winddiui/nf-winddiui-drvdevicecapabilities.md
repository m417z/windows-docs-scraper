## Description

A printer interface DLL's **DrvDeviceCapabilities** function returns requested information about a printer's capabilities.

## Parameters

### `hPrinter`

Caller-supplied printer handle.

### `pszDeviceName` [in]

Caller-supplied pointer to a printer name string.

### `Capability`

Caller-supplied bit flag indicating the information being requested. This can be one of the flags listed in the following table. (The flags are defined in header file Wingdi.h.)

| Flag | Definition |
|---|---|
| DC_BINADJUST | Not used for NT-based operating systems. |
| DC_BINNAMES | The *pOutput* parameter points to a buffer that the function should fill with an array of string buffers, each 24 characters in length. Each string buffer in the array should contain a wide-character, NULL-terminated string specifying the name of a paper source bin. The function's return value should be the number of elements in the returned array. If *pOutput* is **NULL**, the function should just return the number of array elements required. |
| DC_BINS | The *pOutput* parameter points to a buffer that the function should fill with a WORD array. Each array element should contain a DMBIN-prefixed constant (or customized value) representing a supported paper source bin. The function's return value should be the number of elements in the returned array. If *pOutput* is **NULL**, the function should just return the number of array elements required. |
| DC_COLLATE | The *pOutput* parameter is not used. The function's return value should be 1 if the printer supports collating; otherwise, the return value should be zero. |
| DC_COLORDEVICE | The *pOutput* parameter is not used. The function's return value should be 1 if the printer supports color printing; otherwise, the return value should be zero. |
| DC_COPIES | The *pOutput* parameter is not used. The function's return value should be the maximum number of copies the printer can support. |

| DC_EMF_COMPLIANT | Not used for NT-based operating systems. |
| DC_ENUMRESOLUTIONS | The *pOutput* parameter points to a buffer that the function should fill with a LONG array. For each resolution supported by the printer, the function should return two long words (one for the *x* dimension and one for the *y* dimension) of the resolution, in dots per inch. The function's return value should be the number of resolutions supported. If **pOutput** is **NULL**, the function should just return the number of resolutions supported. |
| DC_EXTRA | The *pOutput* parameter is not used. The function's return value should be the **dmDriverExtra** member of the driver's internal \[DEVMODEW\](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure. |

The function's return value should be the **dmFields** member of the driver's internal \[DEVMODEW\](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure. The **dmFields** member indicates which members in the device-independent portion of the DEVMODEW structure are supported by the printer driver. |
| DC_FILEDEPENDENCIES | The *pOutput* parameter points to a buffer that the function should fill with an array of string buffers, each 64 characters in length. Each string buffer in the array should contain a wide-character, NULL-terminated string specifying the name of a file that must be installed with the driver.

| DC_NUP | The *pOutput* parameter points to a buffer that the function should fill with a DWORD array. Each array element should contain an integer representing an N-up option (that is, each integer should represent a supported number of document pages per physical page).

DCTT_DOWNLOAD: The device can accept downloaded TrueType fonts. DCTT_DOWNLOAD_OUTLINE: (Windows 95/98/Me only) The device can download outline TrueType fonts. DCTT_SUBDEV: The device can substitute device fonts for TrueType fonts. |
| DC_VERSION | The *pOutput* parameter is not used. The function's return value should be the **dmSpecVersion** member of the driver's internal \[DEVMODEW\](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure. |

### `pOutput` [out]

A caller-supplied pointer to a buffer to receive function-supplied information. The buffer's use is dependent on the value received for the *Capability* parameter.

### `pDevmode` [in, optional]

A caller-supplied pointer to a [**DEVMODEW**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-devmodew) structure that describes the current print job characteristics. If this parameter is **NULL**, **DrvDeviceCapabilities** retrieves the current default initialization values for the specified printer driver, such as the user default DEVMODEW structure of the print queue.

## Return value

The function's return value is dependent on the value received for the *Capability* parameter. If the received *Capability* value represents a capability that the driver does not support, or if an error is encountered, the function should return GDI_ERROR.

# KeQueryPerformanceCounter function (wdm.h)

## Description

The **KeQueryPerformanceCounter** routine retrieves the current value and frequency of the performance counter.

Use **KeQueryPerformanceCounter** to acquire high resolution (<1Âµs) time stamps for time interval measurements.

## Parameters

### `PerformanceFrequency` [out, optional]

A pointer to a variable to which **KeQueryPerformanceCounter** writes the performance counter frequency, in ticks per second. This parameter is optional and can be NULL if the caller does not need the counter frequency value.

## Return value

**KeQueryPerformanceCounter** returns the performance counter value in units of ticks.

## Remarks

**KeQueryPerformanceCounter** returns a 64-bit integer that represents the current value of a high-resolution monotonically nondecreasing counter.

To obtain the frequency of the performance counter, specify a non-**NULL** pointer value for the *PerformanceFrequency* parameter. The frequency of the performance counter is fixed at system boot and is consistent across all processors. Therefore, a driver can cache the frequency of the performance counter during initialization.

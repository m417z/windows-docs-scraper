# _STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN structure

## Description

The **STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN** structure contains a token value that serves as a representation of a data set range within a file on a volume. This structure is used in performing offload reads and writes.

## Members

### `TokenType`

The type of token contained in this structure. **TokenType** is set to either of the following:

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN_TYPE_ZERO_DATA** | A well-known token format is contained in **Token**. The token represents data considered as all zeros. |
| **Any other value** | A vendor-specific token format is contained in **Token**. |

### `Reserved`

Reserved.

### `TokenIdLength`

The length of the token data in **Token**.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME`

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.StorageOffloadZeroDataToken`

The token value when the data it represents is considered as all zeros. This member is valid when **TokenType** is set to **STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN_TYPE_ZERO_DATA**.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.StorageOffloadZeroDataToken.Reserved2`

Reserved.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.Token`

The vendor-supplied token value representing a data set range for an offload read or write operation.

## Remarks

The token information contained in **STORAGE_OFFLOAD_TOKEN** is generated by the offload read/write infrastructure. All members of this structure should be considered as read only and must not be modified by any callers requesting an offload read or an offload write.

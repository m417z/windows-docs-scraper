# IWDFIoQueue::Start

## Description

[**Warning:** UMDF 2 is the latest version of UMDF and supersedes UMDF 1. All new UMDF drivers should be written using UMDF 2. No new features are being added to UMDF 1 and there is limited support for UMDF 1 on newer versions of Windows 10. Universal Windows drivers must use UMDF 2. For more info, see [Getting Started with UMDF](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/getting-started-with-umdf-version-2).]

The **Start** method enables an I/O queue to start receiving new I/O requests and delivering them to a driver.

This callback function returns the thresholds that are associated with a sensor.

## Parameters

### `Sensor` [in]

A reference to a sensor object.

### `pThresholds` [out]

A list of threshold properties and their values associated with the **Sensor**. For more information, see [SENSOR_COLLECTION_LIST](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/sensorsdef/ns-sensorsdef-sensor_collection_list).

### `pSize`

The size of *pThresholds*.

## Return value

This function returns STATUS_SUCCESS when completed successfully.

**Note** The class extension (CX) only uses the NT_SUCCESS macro to

but does not take any action if the function failed or does not return STATUS_SUCCESS.

## Remarks

This function must be implemented by the driver and is called by the class extension.

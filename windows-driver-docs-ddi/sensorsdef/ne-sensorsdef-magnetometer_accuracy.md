# MAGNETOMETER_ACCURACY enumeration

## Description

This enumeration represents the accuracy states of the magnetometer.

## Constants

### `MagnetometerAccuracy_Unknown`

Indicates that the magnetometer's accuracy cannot be determined.

### `MagnetometerAccuracy_Unreliable`

Indicates that the magnetometer readings are unreliable. The application can choose to prompt the user to calibrate the compass, to improve accuracy.

### `MagnetometerAccuracy_Approximate`

Indicates that the magnetometer readings are approximate values.

### `MagnetometerAccuracy_High`

Indicates that the magnetometer accuracy is set to high.

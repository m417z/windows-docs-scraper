# IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter

## Description

The `IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter` method, if supported, enables a rendering plug-in to capture all output data generated by a Unidrv driver. If this method is not supported, the output data would otherwise be sent to the spooler in a call to the spooler's WritePrinter API (described in the Microsoft Windows SDK documentation).

## Parameters

### `pdevobj`

Pointer to a [DEVOBJ](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/printoem/ns-printoem-_devobj) structure.

### `pBuf`

Pointer to the first byte of an array of bytes that contains the output data generated by the Unidrv driver.

### `cbBuffer`

Specifies the size, in bytes, of the array pointed to by *pBuf*.

### `pcbWritten`

Pointer to a DWORD value that receives the number of bytes of data that were successfully sent to the plug-in.

## Return value

If successful, this method returns S_OK. Otherwise, this method should return an appropriate value in the returned HRESULT.

## Remarks

At [DrvEnablePDEV](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winddi/nf-winddi-drvenablepdev) time, the Unidrv driver calls this method with *pBuf* and *pdevobj* set to **NULL**, and *cbBuf* set to 0, to detect whether the plug-in implements this function. The plug-in should return S_OK to indicate it implements this method, and should return E_NOTIMPL otherwise.

This method should report the number of bytes written to the spooler's **WritePrinter** function in *pcbWritten*. A value of zero carries no special meaning; errors must be reported through the returned HRESULT.

The `IPrintOemUni2::WritePrinter` method is optional. If a rendering plug-in implements this method, the plug-in's [IPrintOemUni::GetImplementedMethod](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/prcomoem/nf-prcomoem-iprintoemuni-getimplementedmethod) method must return S_OK when it receives "WritePrinter" as input.

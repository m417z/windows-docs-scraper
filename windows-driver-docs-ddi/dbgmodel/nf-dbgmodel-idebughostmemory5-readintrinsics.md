## Description

The ReadIntrinsics method reads one or more intrinsic values from the target's address space defined by the given context and location. The number of intrinsics successfully read is returned in the intrinsicsRead on success.

The method allows reading of different types of intrinsics which are indicated by the 'vt' parameter. These types can be:

- VT_I1 - VT_I8: Signed integers
- VT_UI1 - VT_UI1: Unsigned integers
- VT_R4 - VT_R8: Standard floating point (single/double precision) values

## Parameters

### `context`

The currently active context.

### `location`

The location in the target's address space from where intrinsic values will be read.

### `vt`

Specifies the type of intrinsic values to read.

### `count`

Specifies the number of intrinsic values to read.

### `vals`

A pointer to the storage location where the read intrinsic values will be stored.

### `intrinsicsRead`

Returns the number of intrinsics successfully read.

## Return value

This method returns HRESULT which indicates success or failure.

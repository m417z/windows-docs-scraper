## Description

The SwitchBack method restores the debugger engine context to its previous state, reverting any temporary context changes made by the [SwitchTo method](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgmodel/nf-dbgmodel-idebughostcontextalternator-switchto). This allows the debugger to return to its original context, resuming normal operation.

## Return value

## Remarks

Using the SwitchBack method is crucial for maintaining debugging consistency and continuity. Developers should invoke this method after using SwitchTo for a temporary context switch, especially if full access to the original context's functionalities is necessary.

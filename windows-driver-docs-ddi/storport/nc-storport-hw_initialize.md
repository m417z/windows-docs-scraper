# HW_INITIALIZE callback function

## Description

The **HwStorInitialize** routine initializes the miniport driver after a system reboot or power failure occurs. It is called by StorPort after [**HwStorFindAdapter**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_find_adapter) successfully returns. **HwStorInitialize** initializes the HBA and finds all devices that are of interest to the miniport driver.

## Parameters

### `DeviceExtension`

A pointer to the miniport driver's per HBA storage area.

## Return value

If the initialization succeeds, **HwStorInitialize** returns **TRUE**.

## Remarks

The name **HwStorInitialize** is just a placeholder. The actual prototype of this routine is defined in *Storport.h* as follows:

``` c
typedef
BOOLEAN
HW_INITIALIZE (
  _In_ PVOID  DeviceExtension
  );
```

Because **HwStorInitialize** is called at DIRQL, as much of the initialization process as possible should be performed by [**HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine). If so, you must enable the passive initialization routine via [**StorPortEnablePassiveInitialization**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nf-storport-storportenablepassiveinitialization).

If interrupts are generated by the hardware initialization, the [**HwStorInterrupt**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_interrupt) routine will be called. In this case, the **HwStorInitialize** routine should set up any data that **HwStorInterrupt** expects (including a [**HwStorDpcRoutine**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_dpc_routine), if one is used) before it begins to initialize the hardware.

The following responsibilities are shared between **HwStorInitialize** and [**HwStorPassiveInitializeRoutine**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/storport/nc-storport-hw_passive_initialize_routine):

* Initialize hardware for the HBA registers and buffers.

* Initialize and allocate all **DeviceExtension** fields.

* Set up and initialize all events and DPCs that are used by the miniport driver.

### Examples

To define an **HwStorInitialize** callback function, you must first provide a function declaration that identifies the type of callback function you’re defining. Windows provides a set of callback function types for drivers. Declaring a function using the callback function types helps [Code Analysis for Drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/code-analysis-for-drivers), [Static Driver Verifier](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/static-driver-verifier) (SDV), and other verification tools find errors, and it’s a requirement for writing drivers for the Windows operating system.

 For example, to define a **HwStorInitialize** callback routine that is named **MyHwInitialize**, use the **HW_INITIALIZE** type as shown in this code example:

``` c
HW_INITIALIZE MyHwInitialize;
```

Then, implement your callback routine as follows:

``` c
_Use_decl_annotations_
BOOLEAN
  MyHwInitialize( _In_ PVOID DeviceExtension )
  {
      ...
  }
```

The **HW_INITIALIZE** function type is defined in the Storport.h header file. To more accurately identify errors when you run the code analysis tools, be sure to add the _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation to your function definition. The _Use_decl_annotations_ annotation ensures that the annotations that are applied to the **HW_INITIALIZE** function type in the header file are used. For more information about the requirements for function declarations, see [Declaring Functions Using Function Role Types for Storport Drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/declaring-functions-by-using-function-role-types-for-storport-drivers). For information about _Use_decl_annotations_, see [Annotating Function Behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-behavior).

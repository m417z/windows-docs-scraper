# _D3DHAL_DP2ZRANGE structure

## Description

The D3DHAL_DP2ZRANGE structure specifies z-range minimum and maximum in [D3dDrawPrimitives2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dhal/nc-d3dhal-lpd3dhal_drawprimitives2cb).

## Members

### `dvMinZ`

Specifies the minimum z value for the Mvs matrix described in the [Hardware Transform and Lighting](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/hardware-transform-and-lighting) section of the design guide.

### `dvMaxZ`

Specifies the maximum z value for the Mvs matrix described in the [Hardware Transform and Lighting](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/display/hardware-transform-and-lighting) section of the design guide.

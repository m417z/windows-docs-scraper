# IAdapterPnpManagement::PnpQueryStop

## Description

PnpQueryStop provides a notification when PnpQueryStop is invoked by portcls just before succeeding the QueryStop IRP.

## Remarks

PnpQueryStop is invoked by portcls just before succeeding the QueryStop IRP. This is just a notification and the call doesnâ€™t return a value.

Note Portcls acquires the device global lock before making this call, thus the miniport must execute this call as fast as possible. While a Stop is pending, Portcls will block (hold) any new create requests.

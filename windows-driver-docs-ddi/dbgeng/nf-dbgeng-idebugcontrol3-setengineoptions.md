# IDebugControl3::SetEngineOptions

## Description

The **SetEngineOptions** method changes the engine's options.

## Parameters

### `Options` [in]

Specifies the engine's new options. *Options* is a bit-set; it will replace the existing symbol options. For a description of the engine options, see Remarks.

## Return value

This method may also return error values. See [Return Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/hresult-values) for more details.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method was successful. |

## Remarks

This method will set the engine's options to those specified in *Options*. Unlike [AddEngineOptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugcontrol3-addengineoptions), any symbol options that are not listed in the *Options* bit-set will be removed.

After the engine options have been changed, the engine sends out notification to each client's event callback object by passing the DEBUG_CES_ENGINE_OPTIONS flag to the [IDebugEventCallbacks::ChangeEngineState](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/dbgeng/nf-dbgeng-idebugeventcallbacks-changeenginestate) method.

The following global options affect the behavior of the [debugger engine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/introduction):

| Constant | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_IGNORE_DBGHELP_VERSION** | The debugger engine generates a warning instead of an error if the version of the DbgHelp DLL does not match the version of the debugger engine. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_IGNORE_EXTENSION_VERSIONS** | Disable version checking for extensions. This suppresses the debugger engine's call to [CheckVersion](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdbgexts/nc-wdbgexts-pwindbg_check_version). |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_ALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS** | Network shares can be used for loading symbols and extensions. This option prevents the engine from disallowing network paths when debugging some system processes and should be used with caution.<br><br>This option cannot be set if DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS is set. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS** | Network shares cannot be used for loading symbols and extensions. The engine attempts to set this option when debugging some system processes.<br><br>This option cannot be set if DEBUG_ENGOPT_ALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS is set. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_NETWORK_PATHS** | Bitwise OR of DEBUG_ENGOPT_ALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS and DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISALLOW_NETWORK_PATHS. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_IGNORE_LOADER_EXCEPTIONS** | Ignore expected first-chance exceptions that are generated by the loader in certain versions of Windows.<br><br>For example, this option allows Windows 3.51 binaries to run when debugging Windows 3.1 and 3.5 systems. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_INITIAL_BREAK** | Break into the debugger at the target's initial event. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_INITIAL_MODULE_BREAK** | Break into the debugger when the target loads its first module. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_FINAL_BREAK** | Break into the debugger at the target's final event. In a live user-mode target, this is when the process exits. It has no effect in kernel mode. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_NO_EXECUTE_REPEAT** | When given an empty command, the debugger engine does not repeat the last command. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_FAIL_INCOMPLETE_INFORMATION** | Prevent the debugger from loading modules whose images cannot be mapped.<br><br>The debugger attempts to load images when debugging minidumps that do not contain images. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_ALLOW_READ_ONLY_BREAKPOINTS** | Allow the debugger engine to manipulate page protections on the target to allow for setting software breakpoints in a read-only section of memory.<br><br>When setting software breakpoints, the engine transparently alters the target's memory to insert an interrupt instruction. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_SYNCHRONIZE_BREAKPOINTS** | In live user-mode debugging, the engine performs extra work when inserting and removing breakpoints to ensure that all [threads](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/controlling-threads-and-processes) in the target have a consistent breakpoint state at all times.<br><br>This option is useful when multiple threads can use the code for which the breakpoint is set. However, it can introduce the possibility of deadlocks. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISALLOW_SHELL_COMMANDS** | Disallow executing shell commands through the debugger.<br><br>After this option has been set, it cannot be unset. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_KD_QUIET_MODE** | Turn on quiet mode. For more information, see [sq (Set Quiet Mode)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/sq--set-quiet-mode-). |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISABLE_MANAGED_SUPPORT** | Disables debugger engine support for managed code. If support for managed code is already in use, this option has no effect. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISABLE_MODULE_SYMBOL_LOAD** | The debugger does not load symbols for modules that are loaded while this flag is set. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISABLE_EXECUTION_COMMANDS** | Prevents any commands that would cause the target to begin executing. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISALLOW_IMAGE_FILE_MAPPING** | Disallows mapping of image files from disk. For example, this option disallows image mapping for memory content during debugging of minidump files. This option does not affect existing mappings; it affects only subsequent attempts to map image files. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_PREFER_DML** | The debugger runs DML-enhanced versions of commands and operations by default. |
| **DEBUG_ENGOPT_DISABLESQM** | Disables upload of Software Quality Metrics (SQM) data. |

# _D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_TYPE enumeration

## Description

The D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_TYPE enumeration defines the levels of full-scene multisampling that the device can apply.

## Constants

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_NONE`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_NONMASKABLE`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_2_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_3_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_4_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_5_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_6_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_7_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_8_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_9_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_10_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_11_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_12_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_13_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_14_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_15_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_16_SAMPLES`

The level of full-scene multisampling available.

### `D3DDDIMULTISAMPLE_FORCE_UINT`

Forces this enumeration to compile to 32 bits in size. Without this value, some compilers would allow this enumeration to compile to a size other than 32 bits. This value is not used.

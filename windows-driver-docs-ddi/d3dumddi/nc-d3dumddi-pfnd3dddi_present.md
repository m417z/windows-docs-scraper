# PFND3DDDI_PRESENT callback function

## Description

The *Present* function notifies the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and requests that the driver display the source surface by either copying or flipping or that the driver perform a color-fill operation.

## Parameters

### `hDevice`

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### `unnamedParam2`

*pData* [in]

A pointer to a [D3DDDIARG_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present) structure that describes the resource to display.

## Return value

*Present* returns one of the following values:

|Return code|Description|
|--- |--- |
|S_OK|The resource is successfully displayed.|
|E_OUTOFMEMORY|Present could not allocate the required memory for it to complete.|

## Remarks

The Microsoft Direct3D runtime calls the user-mode display driver's *Present* function to notify the user-mode display driver that an application finished rendering and to request that the driver display out the source surface or that the driver perform a color-fill operation. If the **hSrcResource** member of the [D3DDDIARG_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present) structure that the *pData* parameter points to is non-**NULL**, *Present* requests that the user-mode display driver display new content to the screen; if **hSrcResource** is **NULL**, *Present* requests that the user-mode display driver perform a color-fill operation to the screen.

If the **hDstResource** member of the [D3DDDIARG_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present) structure is **NULL**, the destination surface is unknown. In addition, the destination surface and a list of clipping rectangles are determined in kernel mode before sending the hardware command stream through DMA to the graphics processor.

As a result, the user-mode display driver cannot generate hardware instructions to perform the present operation. These hardware instructions must be generated by the display miniport driver. However, when the **hSrcResource** member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-**NULL**, the user-mode display driver must derive the allocation handle to the source surface and insert this handle in the **hSrcAllocation** member of the [D3DDDICB_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_present) structure in a call to the [pfnPresentCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_presentcb) function. The display miniport driver can then successfully generate the hardware instructions. The user-mode display driver typically derives the allocation handle from the resource information in the [D3DDDIARG_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddiarg_present) structure.

If the **hDstResource** member of D3DDDIARG_PRESENT is non-**NULL**, the destination surface for the present is known and the user-mode display driver must fill in the **hDstAllocation** member of [D3DDDICB_PRESENT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/ns-d3dumddi-_d3dddicb_present) with the corresponding allocation handle.

If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of less than 0x0000000C (the driver returns this value in the **DriverVersion** member of the [D3D10DDIARG_OPENADAPTER](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/ns-d3d10umddi-d3d10ddiarg_openadapter) structure in a call to the driver's [OpenAdapter](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_openadapter) function), the Direct3D runtime first calls the user-mode display driver's [Flush](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wudfddi/nf-wudfddi-iwdfworkitem-flush) function to submit any outstanding hardware commands in the command buffer before the runtime calls the user-mode display driver's *Present* function. In this way, the user-mode display driver's *Present* function is serialized with render operations (that is, calls to the [pfnRenderCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_rendercb) function). If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in windowed mode, the runtime also calls *Flush* before it calls *Present*. If a user-mode display driver exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater and the calling application runs in full-screen mode, the runtime will not call *Flush* before it calls *Present*. This behavior allows drivers that implement their own threading to queue present calls. A driver that exposes a DDI version of 0x0000000C or greater must call **pfnRenderCb** to internally flush any outstanding command buffers before the driver calls the [pfnPresentCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3dumddi/nc-d3dumddi-pfnd3dddi_presentcb) function.

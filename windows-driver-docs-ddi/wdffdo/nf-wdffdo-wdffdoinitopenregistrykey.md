# WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey function

## Description

[Applies to KMDF and UMDF]

The **WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey** method opens a device's hardware key or a driver's software key in the registry and creates a framework registry-key object that represents the registry key.

## Parameters

### `DeviceInit` [in]

A pointer to a [WDFDEVICE_INIT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/wdfdevice_init) structure that the driver obtained from its [EvtDriverDeviceAdd](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add) callback function.

### `DeviceInstanceKeyType` [in]

Specifies which key or subkey to open.

> [!NOTE]
> UMDF does not support creating subkeys.

This is a bitwise OR of the following flags (which are defined in *Wdm.h*).

| DeviceInstanceKeyType flag | Meaning | Framework |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE** | Opens the device's hardware key. | KMDF/UMDF |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DRIVER** | Opens the driver's software key. A UMDF driver that sets this flag must also set *DesiredAccess* to **KEY_READ**. Otherwise this method returns **STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED**. | KMDF/UMDF |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_CURRENT_HWPROFILE** | A KMDF driver uses this flag to open the copy of the hardware or software key that is in the current hardware profile. | KMDF |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DRIVER | WDF_REGKEY_DRIVER_SUBKEY** | A UMDF driver uses these flags together to open the **ServiceName** subkey of the driver's software key for read/write access. | UMDF |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE | WDF_REGKEY_DEVICE_SUBKEY** | Similarly, a UMDF driver uses these flags to open the **ServiceName** subkey of the device's hardware key for read/write access. | UMDF |

### `DesiredAccess` [in]

An [ACCESS_MASK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/access-mask)-typed value that specifies access rights that the driver is requesting for the specified registry key.

A KMDF driver typically requests **KEY_READ**, **KEY_WRITE**, or **KEY_READ | KEY_WRITE**.

If you are writing a UMDF driver, use the following table.

| DeviceInstanceKeyType | DesiredAccess |
| --- | --- |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE** | **KEY_READ** |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE | WDF_REGKEY_DEVICE_SUBKEY** | **KEY_READ** or **KEY_READ | KEY_SET_VALUE** |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DRIVER** | **KEY_READ** |
| **PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DRIVER | WDF_REGKEY_DRIVER_SUBKEY** | **KEY_READ** or **KEY_READ | KEY_SET_VALUE** |

As a best practice, ask for only the types of access that your driver needs.

### `KeyAttributes` [in, optional]

A pointer to a [WDF_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfobject/ns-wdfobject-_wdf_object_attributes) structure that contains driver-supplied attributes for the new registry-key object. This parameter is optional and can be WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES.

### `Key` [out]

A pointer to a location that receives a handle to the new registry-key object.

## Return value

**WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey** returns STATUS_SUCCESS if the operation succeeds. Otherwise, the method might return one of the following values:

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST** | [WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdffdo/nf-wdffdo-wdffdoinitopenregistrykey) was not called at IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL. |
| **STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER** | An invalid parameter was specified, or the driver did not obtain the WDFDEVICE_INIT structure from its [EvtDriverDeviceAdd](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdriver/nc-wdfdriver-evt_wdf_driver_device_add) callback function. For UMDF, this return value can indicate insufficient access rights. |
| **STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES** | A registry-key object could not be allocated. |
| **STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND** | The specified registry key does not exist. |

For a list of other return values that the **WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey** method might return, see [Framework Object Creation Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/framework-object-creation-errors).

The method might also return other [NTSTATUS values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/ntstatus-values).

## Remarks

The driver must call **WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey** before calling [WdfDeviceCreate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdfdevice/nf-wdfdevice-wdfdevicecreate). For more information about calling **WdfDeviceCreate**, see [Creating a Framework Device Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-a-framework-device-object).

For more information about the **WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey** method, see [Creating Device Objects in a Function Driver](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/creating-device-objects-in-a-function-driver).

#### Examples

The following code example opens a device's hardware key, with read access.

```cpp
WDFKEY key;
NTSTATUS status;

status = WdfFdoInitOpenRegistryKey(
                                   DeviceInit,
                                   PLUGPLAY_REGKEY_DEVICE,
                                   GENERIC_READ,
                                   WDF_NO_OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES,
                                   &key
                                   );
if (!NT_SUCCESS(status)) {
    return status;
}
```

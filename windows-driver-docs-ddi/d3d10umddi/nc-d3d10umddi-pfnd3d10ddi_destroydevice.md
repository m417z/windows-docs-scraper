# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYDEVICE callback function

## Description

The **DestroyDevice(D3D10)** function destroys the specified device object.

## Parameters

### `unnamedParam1`

*hDevice*

A handle to the display device (graphics context). The Microsoft Direct3D runtime will free the memory region that it previously allocated for the object. Therefore, the driver can no longer access this memory region.

## Remarks

The driver can use the [pfnSetErrorCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb) callback function to set an error code.

Before the Direct3D runtime calls **DestroyDevice(D3D10)**, it destroys all of the display device's child objects (blend state, resources, and so on).

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the [pfnSetErrorCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb) function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of **DestroyDevice(D3D10)** (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.

# PFND3D10DDI_DESTROYQUERY callback function

## Description

The **DestroyQuery(D3D10)** function destroys the specified query object. The query object can be destroyed only if it is not currently bound to a display device.

## Parameters

### `unnamedParam1`

*hDevice* [in]

A handle to the display device (graphics context).

### `unnamedParam2`

*hQuery* [in]

A handle to the driver's private data for the query object to destroy. The Microsoft Direct3D runtime will free the memory region that it previously allocated for the object. Therefore, the driver can no longer access this memory region.

## Remarks

The driver can use the [pfnSetErrorCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb) callback function to set an error code.

The driver should not encounter any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED. Therefore, if the driver passes any error, except for D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED, in a call to the [pfnSetErrorCb](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/d3d10umddi/nc-d3d10umddi-pfnd3d10ddi_seterror_cb) function, the Direct3D runtime will determine that the error is critical. Even if the device was removed, the driver is not required to return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED; however, if device removal interfered with the operation of **DestroyQuery(D3D10)** (which typically should not happen), the driver can return D3DDDIERR_DEVICEREMOVED.

### `D3D11_1DDI_VIDEO_PROCESSOR_FILTER_STEREO_ADJUSTMENT`

Stereo adjustment filter. When stereo 3-D video is enabled, this filter adjusts the offset between the left and right views, allowing the user to reduce potential eye strain.

The filter value indicates the amount by which the left and right views are adjusted. A positive value shifts the images away from each other: the left image toward the left, and the right image toward the right. A negative value shifts the images in the opposite directions, closer to each other.

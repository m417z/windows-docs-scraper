# QUATERNION structure

## Description

A structure that represents a 4-dimensional vector used for simple 3D rotation operation.

## Members

### `X`

Horizontal vector.

### `Y`

Vertical vector.

### `Z`

Vector on the Z-axis.

### `W`

## Remarks

The rotation is done around the axis formed by the vector v= [X, Y, Z] and is of angle ?, and we have:

>W=cos(theta/2) \
>|v|=sin(theta/2)

# glGetColorTableEXT function

The **glGetColorTableEXT** function gets the color table data of the current targeted texture palette.

## Parameters

*target*

The target texture that is to have its palette changed. Must be TEXTURE\_1D or TEXTURE\_2D.

*format*

The format of the pixel data. The following symbolic constants are accepted.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
|

**GL_RGBA**

| Each pixel is a group of four components in the following order: red, green, blue, alpha. The RGBA format is determined in this way: <br>
1. The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts floating-point values directly to an internal format with unspecified precision. Signed integer values are mapped linearly to the internal format such that the most positive representable integer value maps to 1.0, and the most negative representable integer value maps to -1.0. Unsigned integer data is mapped similarly: the largest integer value maps to 1.0, and zero maps to 0.0.
2. The **glGetColorTableEXT** function multiplies the resulting color values by GL_c_SCALE and adds them to GL_c_BIAS, where *c* is RED, GREEN, BLUE, and ALPHA for the respective color components. The results are clamped to the range [0,1].
3. If GL_MAP_COLOR is **TRUE**, **glGetColorTableEXT** scales each color component by the size of lookup table GL_PIXEL_MAP_c_TO_c, then replaces the component by the value that it references in that table; *c* is R, G, B, or A, respectively.
4. The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts the resulting RGBA colors to fragments by attaching the current raster position z-coordinate and texture coordinates to each pixel, then assigning *x* and *y* window coordinates to the *n*th fragment, such that *x*? = *x*r + *n* mod *width*\
   *y*? = *y*r + *n/width*\
    where (*x*r , *y*r ) is the current raster position.\
5. These pixel fragments are then treated just like the fragments generated by rasterizing points, lines, or polygons. The **glGetColorTableEXT** function applies texture mapping, fog, and all the fragment operations before writing the fragments to the framebuffer.

|

**GL_RED**

| Each pixel is a single red component.<br> The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts this component to the internal format in the same way that the red component of an RGBA pixel is, then converts it to an RGBA pixel with green and blue set to 0.0, and alpha set to 1.0. After this conversion, the pixel is treated just as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.<br> |
|

**GL_GREEN**

| Each pixel is a single green component.<br> The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts this component to the internal format in the same way that the green component of an RGBA pixel is, and then converts it to an RGBA pixel with red and blue set to 0.0, and alpha set to 1.0. After this conversion, the pixel is treated just as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.<br> |
|

**GL_BLUE**

| Each pixel is a single blue component.<br> The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts this component to the internal format in the same way that the blue component of an RGBA pixel is, and then converts it to an RGBA pixel with red and green set to 0.0, and alpha set to 1.0. After this conversion, the pixel is treated just as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.<br> |
|

**GL_ALPHA**

| Each pixel is a single alpha component.<br> The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts this component to the internal format in the same way that the alpha component of an RGBA pixel is, and then converts it to an RGBA pixel with red, green, and blue set to 0.0. After this conversion, the pixel is treated just as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.<br> |
|

**GL_RGB**

| Each pixel is a group of three components in this order: red, green, blue.<br> The **glGetColorTableEXT** function converts each component to the internal format in the same way that the red, green, and blue components of an RGBA pixel are. The color triple is converted to an RGBA pixel with alpha set to 1.0. After this conversion, the pixel is treated just as if it had been read as an RGBA pixel.<br> |
|

**GL_BGR_EXT**

| Each pixel is a group of three components in this order: blue, green, red.<br> GL_BGR_EXT provides a format that matches the memory layout of Microsoft Windows device-independent bitmaps (DIBs). Thus, your applications can use the same data with Windows function calls and OpenGL pixel function calls.<br> |
|

**GL_BGRA_EXT**

| Each pixel is a group of four components in this order: blue, green, red, alpha.<br> GL_BGRA_EXT provides a format that matches the memory layout of Windows device-independent bitmaps (DIBs). Thus your applications can use the same data with Windows function calls and OpenGL pixel function calls.<br> |

*type*

The data type for *data*. The following are the accepted symbolic constants and their meanings.

| Value | Meaning |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|

**GL\_UNSIGNED\_BYTE**

| Unsigned 8-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_BYTE**

| Signed 8-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_UNSIGNED\_SHORT**

| Unsigned 16-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_SHORT**

| Signed 16-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_UNSIGNED\_INT**

| Unsigned 32-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_INT**

| 32-bit integer<br> |
|

**GL\_FLOAT**

| Single-precision floating-point value<br> |

*data*

Points to the location where returned color table information is to be stored. Each color table entry is stored as if it was a single pixel of a 1-D texture. Because all textures have a default palette, **glGetColorTableEXT** always returns palette information even if the texture data is not in a paletted format.

## Return value

This function does not return a value.

## Error codes

The following error codes can be retrieved by the [**glGetError**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glgeterror) function.

| Name | Meaning |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GL\_INVALID\_ENUM** | *target*, *format*, or *type* was not an accepted value.<br> |
| **GL\_INVALID\_OPERATION** | The function was called between a call to [**glBegin**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glbegin) and the corresponding call to [**glEnd**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glend).<br> |

## Remarks

The **glGetColorTableEXT** function gets the actual color table data specified by [**glColorTableEXT**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glcolortableext) and [**glColorSubTableEXT**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glcolorsubtableext).

The **glGetColorTableEXT** function is an extension function that is not part of the standard OpenGL library but is part of the GL\_EXT\_paletted\_texture extension. To check whether your implementation of OpenGL supports **glGetColorTableEXT**, call [**glGetString**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/opengl/glgetstring)(GL\_EXTENSIONS). If it returns GL\_EXT\_paletted\_texture, **glGetColorTableEXT** is supported. To obtain the function address of an extension function, call [**wglGetProcAddress**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-wglgetprocaddress).

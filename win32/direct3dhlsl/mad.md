# mad function

Performs an arithmetic multiply/add operation on three values.

## Parameters

*mvalue* \[in\]

Type: **numeric**

The multiplication value.

*avalue* \[in\]

Type: **numeric**

The first addition value.

*bvalue* \[in\]

Type: **numeric**

The second addition value.

## Return value

Type: **numeric**

The result of *mvalue* \* *avalue* + *bvalue*.

## Remarks

### Minimum Shader Model

This function is supported in the following shader models.

| Shader Model | Supported |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| [Shader Model 5](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/d3d11-graphics-reference-sm5) and higher shader models | yes |

This function is supported in the following types of shaders:

| Vertex | Hull | Domain | Geometry | Pixel | Compute |
|--------|------|--------|----------|-------|---------|
| x | x | x | x | x | x |

Shader authors can use the **mad** instrinsic to explicitly target the **mad** hardware instruction in the compiled shader output, which is particularly useful with shaders that mark results with the [precise](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-appendix-keywords) keyword. The **mad** instruction can be implemented in hardware as either "fused," which offers higher precision than implementing a **mul** instruction followed by an **add** instruction, or as a **mul** + **add**.

If shader authors use the **mad** instrinsic to calculate a result that the shader marked as precise, they indicate to the hardware to use any valid implementation of the **mad** instruction (fused or not) as long as the implementation is consistent for all uses of that **mad** intrinsic in any shader on that hardware. Shaders can then take advantage of potential performance improvements by using a native **mad** instruction (versus **mul** + **add**) on some hardware. The result of performing a native **mad** hardware instruction might or might not be different than performing a **mul** followed by an **add**. However, whatever the result is, the result must be consistent for the same operation to occur in multiple shaders or different parts of a shader.

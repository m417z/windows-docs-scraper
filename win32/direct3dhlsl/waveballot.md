# WaveActiveBallot function

Returns a uint4 containing a bitmask of the evaluation of the Boolean expression for all active lanes in the current wave.

## Parameters

*expr*

The boolean expression to evaluate.

## Return value

A uint4 containing a bitmask of the evaluation of the Boolean expression for all active lanes in the current wave. The least-significant bit corresponds to the lane with index zero. The bits corresponding to inactive lanes will be zero. The bits that are greater than or equal to [**WaveGetLaneCount**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/wavegetlanecount) will be zero.

## Remarks

Different GPUs have different SIMD processor widths (lane counts). Most of these **WaveXXX** functions are able to operate at level of abstraction where SIMD machine width is concealed. To maximize portability of code across GPUs, use the intrinsics that donâ€™t rely on machine width. For example, use:

``` syntax
uint result = WaveActiveCountBits( bBit );
```

Instead of:

``` syntax
uint result = countbits( WaveActiveBallot( bBit ) );
```

This function is supported from shader model 6.0 in all shader stages.

## Examples

``` syntax
// get a bitwise representation of the number of currently active lanes:
uint4 waveBits = WaveActiveBallot( true ); // convert to bits
```

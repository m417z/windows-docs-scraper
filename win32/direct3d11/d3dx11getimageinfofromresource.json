Note Instead of using this function, we recommend that you use resource functions, then use DirectXTex library (tools), LoadFromXXXMemory (where XXX is WIC, DDS, or TGA; WIC doesn't support DDS and TGA; D3DX 9 supported TGA as a common art source format for games). Retrieves information about a given image in a resource.",

# JetResetTableSequential Function

_**Applies to:** Windows | Windows Server_

## JetResetTableSequential Function

The **JetResetTableSequential** function notifies the database engine that the application is no longer scanning the entire current index containing a given cursor. This call reverses a notification sent by [JetSetTableSequential](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/jetsettablesequential-function).

**Windows XP:** **JetResetTableSequential** is introduced in Windows XP.

```cpp
    JET_ERR JET_API JetResetTableSequential(
      __in          JET_SESID sesid,
      __in          JET_TABLEID tableid,
      __in          JET_GRBIT grbit
    );
```

### Parameters

*sesid*

The session to use for this call.

*tableid*

The cursor to use for this call.

*grbit*

Reserved for future use.

### Return Value

This function returns the [JET_ERR](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/jet-err) datatype with one of the following return codes. For more information about the possible ESE errors, see [Extensible Storage Engine Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/extensible-storage-engine-errors) and [Error Handling Parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/error-handling-parameters).

Description

|
|--------------------|--------------------|
|

JET_errSuccess

|

The operation completed successfully.

|
|

JET_errClientRequestToStopJetService

|

It is not possible to complete the operation because all activity on the instance associated with the session has ceased as a result of a call to [JetStopService](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/gg269240(v=exchg.10).md).

|
|

JET_errInstanceUnavailable

|

It is not possible to complete the operation because the instance associated with the session has encountered a fatal error that requires that access to all data be revoked to protect the integrity of that data. This error will only be returned by Windows XP and later releases.

|
|

JET_errNotInitialized

|

It is not possible to complete the operation because the instance associated with the session has not been initialized yet.

|
|

JET_errRestoreInProgress

|

It is not possible to complete the operation because a restore operation is in progress on the instance associated with the session.

|
|

JET_errTermInProgress

|

It is not possible to complete the operation because the instance associated with the session is being shut down.

|

On success, the current index of the cursor is no longer optimized for a sequential scan of the entire index. No change to the database state will occur.

On failure, no change to the configuration of the cursor will occur. No change to the database state will occur.

#### Remarks

It is safe to make this call against a cursor that has not been previously configured by a call to [JetSetTableSequential](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/extensible-storage-engine/jetsettablesequential-function).

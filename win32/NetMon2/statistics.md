# STATISTICS structure

The **STATISTICS** structure provides statistics for the capture. Some of these statistics are generated by Network Monitor, while others are generated by the NIC that the NPP is connected to.

## Members

**TimeElapsed**

Elapsed time, in microseconds.

**TotalFramesCaptured**

Total number of frames currently stored. This number is limited by the size of the capture file or buffer used to store the frames.

**TotalBytesCaptured**

Total number of bytes currently stored. This number is limited by the size of the capture file or buffer used to store the frames.

**TotalFramesFiltered**

Total number of frames that passed through the current capture filter. If a filter is not used, this value is the same as **TotalFramesSeen**.

**TotalBytesFiltered**

Total number of frames that passed through the current capture filter. If a filter is not used, this value is the same as **TotalBytesSeen**.

**TotalMulticastsFiltered**

This member is obsolete.

**TotalBroadcastsFiltered**

This member is obsolete.

**TotalFramesSeen**

Total number of frames handled by the NIC.

**TotalBytesSeen**

Total number of bytes handled by the NIC.

**TotalMulticastsReceived**

This member is obsolete.

**TotalBroadcastsReceived**

This member is obsolete.

**TotalFramesDropped**

Total number of frames dropped (frames that passed the filter but were not saved).

**TotalFramesDroppedFromBuffer**

Number of frames dropped from the capture file or buffer. When the buffer is full, older frames are removed to make room for new ones.

**MacFramesReceived**

Number of frames that the NIC reports having received.

**MacCRCErrors**

Number of CRC errors reported by the NIC.

**MacBytesReceivedEx**

Number of bytes that the NIC reports having received.

**MacFramesDropped\_NoBuffers**

Number of frames that the NIC reports having dropped due to a lack of buffer space.

**MacMulticastsReceived**

Number of multicasts the NIC reports having received.

**MacBroadcastsReceived**

Number of broadcasts the NIC reports having received.

**MacFramesDropped\_HwError**

Number of frames the NIC reports as having dropped due to hardware errors.

## Remarks

This structure is used to retrieve [*total statistics*](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/netmon2/t), and to pause or stop the current capture.

Total statistics cannot be retrieved when using the [IESP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/netmon2/iesp) NPP interface.

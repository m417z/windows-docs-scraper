# D3DBASISTYPE enumeration

Defines the basis type of a high-order patch surface.

## Constants

**D3DBASIS\_BEZIER**

Input vertices are treated as a series of BÃ©zier patches. The number of vertices specified must be divisible by 4. Portions of the mesh beyond this criterion will not be rendered. Full continuity is assumed between sub-patches in the interior of the surface rendered by each call. Only the vertices at the corners of each sub-patch are guaranteed to lie on the resulting surface.

**D3DBASIS\_BSPLINE**

Input vertices are treated as control points of a B-spline surface. The number of apertures rendered is two fewer than the number of apertures in that direction. In general, the generated surface does not contain the control vertices specified.

**D3DBASIS\_CATMULL\_ROM**

An interpolating basis defines the surface so that the surface goes through all the input vertices specified. In DirectX 8, this was D3DBASIS\_INTERPOLATE.

**D3DBASIS\_FORCE\_DWORD**

Forces this enumeration to compile to 32 bits in size. Without this value, some compilers would allow this enumeration to compile to a size other than 32 bits. This value is not used.

## Remarks

The members of **D3DBASISTYPE** specify the formulation to be used in evaluating the high-order patch surface primitive during tessellation.

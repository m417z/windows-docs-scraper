# D3DCOLORVALUE structure (D3D9Types.h)

Describes color values.

## Members

**r**

Type: **float**

Floating-point value that specifies the red component of a color. This value generally is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. A value of 0.0 indicates the complete absence of the red component, while a value of 1.0 indicates that red is fully present.

**g**

Type: **float**

Floating-point value that specifies the green component of a color. This value generally is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. A value of 0.0 indicates the complete absence of the green component, while a value of 1.0 indicates that green is fully present.

**b**

Type: **float**

Floating-point value that specifies the blue component of a color. This value generally is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. A value of 0.0 indicates the complete absence of the blue component, while a value of 1.0 indicates that blue is fully present.

**a**

Type: **float**

Floating-point value that specifies the alpha component of a color. This value generally is in the range from 0.0 through 1.0. A value of 0.0 indicates fully transparent, while a value of 1.0 indicates fully opaque.

## Remarks

You can set the members of this structure to values outside the range of 0 through 1 to implement some unusual effects. Values greater than 1 produce strong lights that tend to wash out a scene. Negative values produce dark lights that actually remove light from a scene.

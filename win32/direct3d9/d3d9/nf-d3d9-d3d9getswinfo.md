## Remarks

This function doesn't have an associated header file or library file. Your application can call [**LoadLibrary**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) with the DLL name (`rgb9rast.dll`) to obtain a module handle. It can then call [**GetProcAddress**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) with the module handle and the name of this function to get the function address.

Also, on GitHub, see the sample apps [DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) 2 sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/multimedia/mediafoundation/dxva2_videoproc) and [DXVA-HD sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/multimedia/mediafoundation/DXVA_HD). Those sample apps make calls to **D3D9GetSWInfo**.

# D3DXSHCOMPRESSQUALITYTYPE enumeration

Spherical harmonic (SH) compression setting.

## Constants

**D3DXSHCQUAL\_FASTLOWQUALITY**

The data compression is low quality, but is fast to compress.

**D3DXSHCQUAL\_SLOWHIGHQUALITY**

The data compression is high quality, but is slow to compress.

**D3DXSHCQUAL\_FORCE\_DWORD**

Forces this enumeration to compile to 32 bits in size. Without this value, some compilers would allow this enumeration to compile to a size other than 32 bits. This value is not used.

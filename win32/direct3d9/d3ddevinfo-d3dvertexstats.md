# D3DDEVINFO\_D3DVERTEXSTATS structure

Reports the number of triangles that have been processed and clipped by the runtime's software vertex processing.

## Members

**NumRenderedTriangles**

Type: **[**DWORD**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Total number of triangles that are not clipped in this frame.

**NumExtraClippingTriangles**

Type: **[**DWORD**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Number of new triangles generated by clipping.

## Remarks

Use the debug runtime and software vertex processing to get the number of non-clipped and clipped primitives for a particular scene. Primitives will typically be clipped based on a guard band (if one is present). The clipping guard band is set with parameters such as GuardBandLeft in [**D3DCAPS9**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/D3D9Caps/ns-d3d9caps-d3dcaps9).

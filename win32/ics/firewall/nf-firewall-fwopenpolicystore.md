# FWOpenPolicyStore function

Requests the server to open the specified policy store. The store can be opened for reading or for editing the firewall policy. Via this function, you also retrieve a handle to the opened store, with which you can then perform operations on the policy store. The server allocates a policy store connection object to track the policy store type and the binary version associated with the handle.

See **Remarks** for info about how to call the function.

## Parameters

`wBinaryVersion`

Specifies the RPC interface binary version. This implies versions of the methods and versions of the structures. This value must be a valid protocol version.

`wszMachineOrGPO`

The object to connect to. A machine name or a GPO path. **NULL** for local machine.

`StoreType`

The policy store type that the client wants to open.

`AccessRight`

The read or read/write access rights that the client is requesting on the store.

`dwFlags`

Not used. The server ignores this parameter; the client should pass a value of zero.

`phPolicyStore`

An output parameter that provides a pointer to an opened policy store **HANDLE**. If successful, this parameter contains a handle to the opened store.

## Return value

0 if successful. If it fails, it returns a nonzero error code, as specified in [MS-ERREF](https://learn.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-erref/1bc92ddf-b79e-413c-bbaa-99a5281a6c90).

## Remarks

This function does not have an associated header file or library file. Your application can call [**LoadLibrary**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya) with the DLL name (`FirewallAPI.dll`) to obtain a module handle. It can then call [**GetProcAddress**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-getprocaddress) with the module handle and the name of this function to get the function address.

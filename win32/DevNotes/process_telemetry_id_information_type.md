# PROCESS_TELEMETRY_ID_INFORMATION_TYPE structure

Specifies metadata about the process.

## Members

**HeaderSize**

The size, in bytes, of the resource header data that follows.

**ProcessId**

The ID of the process.

**ProcessStartKey**

The time the process was created.

**CreateInterruptTime**

Current interrupt-time count.

Interrupt-time count is not subject to adjustments by users or the Windows time service (see [Interrupt Time](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/SysInfo/interrupt-time)).

**CreateUnbiasedInterruptTime**

Current unbiased interrupt-time count.

Unbiased interrupt-time means that only time that the system is in the working state is countedâ€”therefore, the interrupt-time count is not "biased" by time the system spends in sleep or hibernation (see [Interrupt Time](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/SysInfo/interrupt-time)).

**ProcessSequenceNumber**

The process sequence number.

**SessionCreateTime**

Date and time the session was created.

**SessionId**

The unique session associated with client connection.

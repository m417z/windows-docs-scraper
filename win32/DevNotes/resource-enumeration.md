# Resource Enumeration

Developers can use resource enumeration as part of the instrumentation that provides specific types of information about their applications.

Microsoft builds instrumentation into the Windows operating system, but these features are tied so closely to the operating system that they may be of limited use to application developers. Microsoft is making a resource enumeration application programming interface (API) available that can be used with the following instrumentation resources: heap allocations and handle trace information.

The following topics describe how to use this API in your applications:

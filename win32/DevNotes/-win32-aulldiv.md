# \_aulldiv Routine

Divides two **ULONGLONG** integers.
For example, to divide two uint64 values the compiler might generate a call to the **\_aulldiv** routine.

## Remarks

The **\_aulldiv** routine is a helper routine for the C compiler.
Whether the compiler uses **\_aulldiv** is completely dependent on the optimization set.

This function is used only on x86 platforms.

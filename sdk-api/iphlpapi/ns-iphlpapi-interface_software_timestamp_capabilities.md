## Description

Describes the software timestamping capabilities of a NIC's miniport driver.

For more info, and code examples, see [Packet timestamping](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/iphlp/packet-timestamping).

## Members

### `AllReceive`

Type: **[BOOLEAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Also contains members that describe the software timestamping capabilities of a NIC's miniport driver.
Not a hardware capability. **TRUE** indicates that the NIC's miniport driver can generate a software timestamp for all received packets. A value of **FALSE** indicates that the software is not capable of this.

### `AllTransmit`

Type: **[BOOLEAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Not a hardware capability. Analogous to *AllReceiveSw*, except it applies to the transmit direction. **TRUE** indicates that the NIC's miniport driver can generate a software timestamp for all transmitted packets. A value of **FALSE** indicates that the software is not capable of this.

### `TaggedTransmit`

Type: **[BOOLEAN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types)**

Not a hardware capability. **TRUE** indicates that the NIC's miniport driver can generate a software timestamp for any specific transmitted packet when indicated to do so by the application. A value of **FALSE** indicates that the software is not capable of this.
See [**TIMESTAMPING_CONFIG**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mstcpip/ns-mstcpip-timestamping_config) (and **TIMESTAMPING_FLAG_TX**) to determine how to request a timestamp when sending UDP packets through [Windows Sockets](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/winsock/windows-sockets-start-page-2).

## Remarks

All of the **INTERFACE_SOFTWARE_TIMESTAMP_CAPABILITIES** structure's members represent software timestamp capabilities. The software timestamp generated by the NIC driver corresponds to a counter value obtained by calling [**QueryPerformanceCounter**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/profileapi/nf-profileapi-queryperformancecounter).

Having both hardware and software timestamps enabled together isn't supported.

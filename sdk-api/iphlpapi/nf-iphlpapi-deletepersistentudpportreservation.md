### `NumberOfPorts` [in]

The number of UDP port numbers to delete.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the return value is NO_ERROR.

If the function fails, the return value is one of the following error codes.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED** | Access is denied. This error is returned under several conditions that include the following: the user lacks the required administrative privileges on the local computer or the application is not running in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator). |
| **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER** | An invalid parameter was passed to the function. This error is returned if zero is passed in the *StartPort* or *NumberOfPorts* parameters. |
| **ERROR_NOT_FOUND** | The element was not found. This error is returned if persistent port block specified by the *StartPort* and *NumberOfPorts* parameters could not be found. |
| **Other** | Use [FormatMessage](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-formatmessage) to obtain the message string for the returned error. |

## Remarks

The **DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation** function is defined on Windows Vista and later.

The **DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation** function is used to delete a persistent reservation for a block of UDP ports.

The **DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation** function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If **DeletePersistentUdpPortReservation** is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and **ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED** is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a **requestedExecutionLevel** set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.

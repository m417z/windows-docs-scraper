# IPersistSerializedPropStorage::SetPropertyStorage

## Description

Initializes the property store instance from the specified serialized property storage data.

## Parameters

### `psps` [in]

Type: **PCUSERIALIZEDPROPSTORAGE**

A pointer to the serialized property store data that will be used to initialize the property store.

### `cb` [in]

Type: **DWORD**

The count of bytes contained in the serialized property storage data pointed to by *psps*.

## Return value

Type: **HRESULT**

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code.

## Remarks

The **SERIALIZEDPROPSTORAGE** type is defined in Propsys.h as an incomplete type. It should be treated as an array of **BYTE** values; the format of the data returned is not specified. The data stored as a **SERIALIZEDPROPSTORAGE** structure must have been obtained through a call to [IPersistSerializedPropStorage::GetPropertyStorage](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/propsys/nf-propsys-ipersistserializedpropstorage-getpropertystorage), either directly or through persisted data that was generated by a call to that method.

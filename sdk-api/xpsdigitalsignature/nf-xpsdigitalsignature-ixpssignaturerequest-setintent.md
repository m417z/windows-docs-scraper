## Parameters

### `intent` [in]

The string that describes the intent or meaning of the signature.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the table that follows. For return values that are not listed in this table, see [XPS Digital Signature API Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372949(v=vs.85)) and [XPS Document Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)).

| Return code | Description |

| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | *intent* is **NULL**. |
| **E_UNEXPECTED** | The interface is not connected to the signature manager. |

## Remarks

The signature intent string describes what the signature means to the signer. For example, for the signature intent string "I have read and agree with the contents of this document" the presence of a digital signature means that the signer has read and agrees with the content of the document.

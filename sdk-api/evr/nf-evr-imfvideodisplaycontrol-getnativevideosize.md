# IMFVideoDisplayControl::GetNativeVideoSize

## Description

[The component described on this page, [Enhanced Video Renderer](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/enhanced-video-renderer), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by the Simple Video Renderer (SVR) exposed through the [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine) components. To play video content you should send data into one of these components and allow them to instantiate the new video renderer. These components have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** or the lower level **IMFMediaEngine** APIs to play video media in Windows instead of the EVR, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]

Gets the size and aspect ratio of the video, prior to any stretching by the video renderer.

## Parameters

### `pszVideo` [in, out]

Receives the size of the native video rectangle. This parameter can be **NULL**.

### `pszARVideo` [in, out]

Receives the aspect ratio of the video. This parameter can be **NULL**.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | At least one of the parameters must be non-**NULL**. |
| **MF_E_SHUTDOWN** | The video renderer has been shut down. |

## Remarks

If no media types have been set on any video streams, the method succeeds but all parameters are set to zero.

You can set *pszVideo* or *pszARVideo* to **NULL**, but not both.

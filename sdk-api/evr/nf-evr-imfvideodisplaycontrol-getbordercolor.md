# IMFVideoDisplayControl::GetBorderColor

## Description

[The component described on this page, [Enhanced Video Renderer](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/enhanced-video-renderer), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by the Simple Video Renderer (SVR) exposed through the [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.media.playback.mediaplayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine) components. To play video content you should send data into one of these components and allow them to instantiate the new video renderer. These components have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** or the lower level **IMFMediaEngine** APIs to play video media in Windows instead of the EVR, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.]

Gets the border color for the video.

## Parameters

### `pClr` [out]

Receives the border color, as a **COLORREF** value.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **MF_E_SHUTDOWN** | The video renderer has been shut down. |

## Remarks

The border color is used for areas where the enhanced video renderer (EVR) does not draw any video.

The border color is not used for letterboxing. To get the letterbox color, call [IMFVideoProcessor::GetBackgroundColor](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/evr9/nf-evr9-imfvideoprocessor-getbackgroundcolor).

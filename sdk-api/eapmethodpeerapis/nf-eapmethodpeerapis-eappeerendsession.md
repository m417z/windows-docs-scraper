# EapPeerEndSession function

## Description

Ends an EAP authentication session for the EAP method.

## Parameters

### `sessionHandle` [in]

A pointer to an **EAP_SESSION_HANDLE** structure that contains the unique handle for this EAP authentication session on the EAPHost server. This handle is returned in the *pSessionHandle* parameter in a previous call to [EapPeerBeginSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/eapmethodpeerapis/nf-eapmethodpeerapis-eappeerbeginsession).

### `ppEapError` [out]

A pointer to a pointer to an [EAP_ERROR](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/eaptypes/ns-eaptypes-eap_error) structure that contains any errors raised during the execution of this function call. After consuming the error data, this memory must be freed by calling [EapPeerFreeErrorMemory](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/eapmethodpeerapis/nf-eapmethodpeerapis-eappeerfreeerrormemory).

## Remarks

An authentication session involves a supplicant requesting authentication, and the EAP method that performs the authentication. When a supplicant closes an authentication session with a call to [EapHostPeerEndSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/eappapis/nf-eappapis-eaphostpeerendsession), EAPHost must also close the session for the EAP method that performed the authentication with this API.

This call is performed by a peer-based EAPHost using a function pointer to this API. This API must be implemented on the EAP method loaded by EAPHost, and must strictly conform to the syntax and parameter types specified in the documentation.

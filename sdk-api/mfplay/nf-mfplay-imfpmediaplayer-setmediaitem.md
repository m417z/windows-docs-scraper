# IMFPMediaPlayer::SetMediaItem

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, MFPlay, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Queues a media item for playback.

## Parameters

### `pIMFPMediaItem` [in]

Pointer to the [IMFPMediaItem](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nn-mfplay-imfpmediaitem) interface of the media item.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****S_OK**** | The method succeeded. |
| ****E_INVALIDARG**** | Invalid argument. |
| ****MF_E_DRM_UNSUPPORTED**** | The media item contains protected content. MFPlay currently does not support protected content. |
| ****MF_E_NO_AUDIO_PLAYBACK_DEVICE**** | No audio playback device was found. This error can occur if the media source contains audio, but no audio playback devices are available on the system. |
| ****MF_E_SHUTDOWN**** | The object's [Shutdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayer-shutdown) method was called. |

## Remarks

This method completes asynchronously. When the operation completes, the application's [IMFPMediaPlayerCallback::OnMediaPlayerEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayercallback-onmediaplayerevent) callback method is invoked. The event type is **MFP_EVENT_TYPE_MEDIAITEM_SET**.

To create a media item, call [IMFPMediaPlayer::CreateMediaItemFromObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayer-createmediaitemfromobject) or [IMFPMediaPlayer::CreateMediaItemFromURL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayer-createmediaitemfromurl). A media item must be used with the same MFPlay player object that created that item. If the media item was created by a different instance of the player object, **SetMediaItem** returns **E_INVALIDARG**.

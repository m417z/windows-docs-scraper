# IMFPMediaPlayer::Stop

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, MFPlay, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Stops playback.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **MF_E_SHUTDOWN** | The object's [Shutdown](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayer-shutdown) method was called. |

## Remarks

This method completes asynchronously. When the operation completes, the application's [IMFPMediaPlayerCallback::OnMediaPlayerEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayercallback-onmediaplayerevent) callback method is invoked. The event type is **MFP_EVENT_TYPE_STOP**.

The current media item is still valid. After playback stops, the playback position resets to the beginning of the current media item.

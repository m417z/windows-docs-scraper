# IMFPMediaPlayer::ClearMediaItem

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, MFPlay, is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer) and [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** and **IMFMediaEngine** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

Clears the current media item.

**Note** This method is currently not implemented.

## Return value

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code.

## Remarks

This method stops playback and releases the player object's references to the current media item.

This method completes asynchronously. When the operation completes, the application's [IMFPMediaPlayerCallback::OnMediaPlayerEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfplay/nf-mfplay-imfpmediaplayercallback-onmediaplayerevent) callback method is invoked. The event type is **MFP_EVENT_TYPE_MEDIAITEM_CLEARED**.

# IControlbar::Create

## Description

The **IControlbar::Create** method creates and returns the control requested by the snap-in.

## Parameters

### `nType` [in]

A value that specifies the type of control to be associated; taken from the
[MMC_CONTROL_TYPE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/ne-mmc-mmc_control_type) enumeration.

### `pExtendControlbar` [in]

A pointer to the snap-in's
[IExtendControlbar](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nn-mmc-iextendcontrolbar) interface that is to be associated with the control (toolbar or menu button) that will be created. Notifications generated by the new control will be sent to
[IExtendControlBar::ControlbarNotify](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mmc/nf-mmc-iextendcontrolbar-controlbarnotify).

### `ppUnknown` [out]

A pointer to the address of the IUnknown interface of the control that was created.

## Return value

This method can return one of these values.

## Remarks

The **IControlbar::Create** method increments the reference count on the control bar object it creates, so the snap-in is not required to call the AddRef method on the interface.

Although COMBOBOXBAR is included in Mmc.idl in connection with the nType parameter, it is not implemented.

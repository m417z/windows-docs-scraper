## Parameters

### `_x`

Value of the x-coordinate of the vector, the **x** member of the new
`XMHALF4` instance.

### `_y`

Value of the y-coordinate of the vector, the **y** member of the new
`XMHALF4` instance.

### `_z`

Value of the z-coordinate of the vector, the **z** member of the new
`XMHALF4` instance.

### `_w`

Value of the w-coordinate of the vector, the **w** member of the new
`XMHALF4` instance.

## Remarks

The following pseudocode demonstrates the operation of this constructor:

```

	XMHALF4 instance;

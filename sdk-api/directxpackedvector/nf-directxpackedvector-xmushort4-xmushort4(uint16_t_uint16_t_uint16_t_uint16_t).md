## Description

Initializes a new instance of `XMUSHORT4` from four `uint16_t` arguments.

This constructor initializes a new instance of [XMUSHORT4](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/directxpackedvector/ns-directxpackedvector-xmushort4) from a
four `uint16_t` arguments.

**Note** This constructor is only available under C++.

## Parameters

### `_x`

Value of the x-coordinate of the vector, the **x** member of the new
`XMUSHORT4` instance.

### `_y`

Value of the y-coordinate of the vector, the **y** member of the new
`XMUSHORT4` instance.

### `_z`

Value of the z-coordinate of the vector, the **z** member of the new
`XMUSHORT4` instance.

### `_w`

Value of the w-coordinate of the vector, the **w** member of the new
`XMUSHORT4` instance.

## Remarks

The following pseudocode demonstrates the operation of this constructor:

```

	XMUSHORT4 instance;

	instance.x = _x;
	instance.y = _y;
	instance.z = _z;
	instance.w = _w;

## Remarks

All properties defined by the keys here have reasonable defaults; so
specifying them is optional. In the common case, one should be able
to create a [WS_SECURITY_ALGORITHM_SUITE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/webservices/ns-webservices-ws_security_algorithm_suite) without setting any of
the properties below.

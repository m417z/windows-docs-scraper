## Remarks

The message must be in [WS_MESSAGE_STATE_READING](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_message_state) state. Upon success, it will
transition to **WS_MESSAGE_STATE_DONE** state.

When streaming input is used ([WS_STREAMED_INPUT_TRANSFER_MODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/webservices/ne-webservices-ws_transfer_mode)),
the channel will automatically make sure that there are bytes available before reading the
end of the message (the closing body and envelope tags).

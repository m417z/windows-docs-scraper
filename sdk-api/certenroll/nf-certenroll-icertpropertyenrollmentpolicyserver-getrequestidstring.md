## Return value

If the function succeeds, the function returns **S_OK**.

If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see [Common HRESULT Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values).

## Remarks

# IX509CertificateRequestCmc2::CheckSignature

## Description

The **CheckSignature** method verifies that the certificate request has been signed and that the signature is valid.

## Parameters

### `AllowedSignatureTypes` [in]

A value from the [Pkcs10AllowedSignatureTypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/ne-certenroll-pkcs10allowedsignaturetypes) enumeration. This can be a bitwise combination of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **AllowedKeySignature** | Signatures generated by using asymmetric keys are permitted. If this flag is set, the signature is verified against the public key in the inner PKCS #10 request. This is the default flag. |
| **AllowedNullSignature** | Null-signed signatures are permitted. |

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the function returns **S_OK**.

If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see [Common HRESULT Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **CRYPT_E_NO_SIGNER** | The certificate request has not been signed. |
| **ERROR_INVALID_STATE** | The signature type is not specified by the *AllowedSignatureTypes* parameter. |
| **NTE_BAD_SIGNATURE** | The value specified by the *AllowedSignatureTypes* parameter is not a member of the [Pkcs10AllowedSignatureTypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/ne-certenroll-pkcs10allowedsignaturetypes) enumeration type. |

## Remarks

This method uses the public key to decrypt the signature and compares the signature to a hash of the certificate request.

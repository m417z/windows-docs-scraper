# IX509CertificateRequestPkcs10::IsSmartCard

## Description

The **IsSmartCard** method retrieves a Boolean value that indicates whether any of the cryptographic providers associated with the request object is a smart card provider.

## Parameters

### `pValue` [out]

Pointer to a **VARIANT_BOOL** variable that indicates whether any of the enumerated and selected providers is a smart card provider.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the function returns **S_OK**.

If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see [Common HRESULT Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values).

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****CERTSRV_E_PROPERTY_EMPTY**** | The private key cannot be found, or the [ICspInformation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-icspinformation) object associated with the private key cannot be found. |
| ****OLE_E_BLANK**** | The object is not initialized. |

## Remarks

The **IsSmartCard** method first checks the provider associated with the private key. If that provider is not for a smart card, the method iterates through the [CspStatuses](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nf-certenroll-ix509certificaterequestpkcs10-get_cspstatuses) collection until it finds a selected provider that is. If no selected smart card providers are found, the method returns **False**. You must initialize the [IX509CertificateRequestPkcs10](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509certificaterequestpkcs10) object before calling this method.

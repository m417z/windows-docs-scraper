# IX509CertificateRequestCertificate::CheckPublicKeySignature

## Description

The **CheckPublicKeySignature** method verifies the certificate signature by using the public key of the signing certificate.

## Parameters

### `pPublicKey` [in]

Pointer to an [IX509PublicKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509publickey) interface that represents the public key.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the function returns **S_OK**.

If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see [Common HRESULT Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values).

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****CRYPT_E_NO_SIGNER**** | The signature cannot be found. |
| ****HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_INVALID_STATE)**** | The [IX509PublicKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/certenroll/nn-certenroll-ix509publickey) object has not been initialized. |
| ****OLE_E_BLANK**** | The request object has not been initialized. |

## Remarks

This method decrypts the signature and compares it to a hash of the certificate, using the hash algorithm specified by the signature. You must initialize the request object before calling this property. For more information, see any of the following methods:

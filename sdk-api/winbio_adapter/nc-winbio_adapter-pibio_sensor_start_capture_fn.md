# PIBIO_SENSOR_START_CAPTURE_FN callback function

## Description

Called by the Windows Biometric Framework to begin an asynchronous biometric capture.

## Parameters

### `Pipeline` [in, out]

Pointer to the [WINBIO_PIPELINE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/ns-winbio_adapter-winbio_pipeline) structure associated with the biometric unit performing the operation.

### `Purpose` [in]

A **WINBIO_BIR_PURPOSE** bitmask that specifies the intended use of the sample. This can be a bitwise **OR** of the following values:

* WINBIO_PURPOSE_VERIFY
* WINBIO_PURPOSE_IDENTIFY
* WINBIO_PURPOSE_ENROLL
* WINBIO_PURPOSE_ENROLL_FOR_VERIFICATION
* WINBIO_PURPOSE_ENROLL_FOR_IDENTIFICATION

Some sensors have the ability to capture biometric information at multiple resolutions. If the *Purpose* parameter specifies more than one flag, your adapter should use the flag that represents the highest resolution to determine the resolution of the capture operation.

### `Overlapped` [out]

Address of a variable that receives a pointer to an **OVERLAPPED** structure that tracks the state of the asynchronous capture operation. This structure is created and managed by the sensor adapter but is used by the Windows Biometric Framework for synchronization. For more information, see the Remarks section.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. The following values will be recognized by the Windows Biometric Framework.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_POINTER** | A mandatory pointer argument is **NULL**. |
| ****E_INVALIDARG**** | The *Purpose* parameter is not valid. |
| ****E_OUTOFMEMORY**** | There was not enough memory to perform the operation. |
| **WINBIO_E_DEVICE_BUSY** | The device is not ready to capture data. |
| **WINBIO_E_DEVICE_FAILURE** | There was a device failure. |
| **WINBIO_E_INVALID_DEVICE_STATE** | The **SensorContext** member of the [WINBIO_PIPELINE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/ns-winbio_adapter-winbio_pipeline) structure pointed to by the *Pipeline* argument is **NULL** or the **SensorHandle** member is set to **INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE**. |

## Remarks

This function does not block. If the adapter issues multiple commands to the sensor to prepare for a capture operation, all but the final command can be synchronous. The final command, issued immediately before *SensorAdapterStartCapture* returns control to the Windows Biometric Framework, must be asynchronous and must use overlapped I/O.

To use overlapped I/O, begin by adding an **OVERLAPPED** object to the definition of the private sensor adapter context structure. This structure is available to the adapter through the **SensorContext** field of the [WINBIO_PIPELINE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/ns-winbio_adapter-winbio_pipeline) object.

When you implement [SensorAdapterAttach](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/nc-winbio_adapter-pibio_sensor_attach_fn), you must perform the following actions to initialize the **OVERLAPPED** structure:

* Clear the **OVERLAPPED** structure by calling the [ZeroMemory](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/aa366920(v=vs.85)) function.
* Create a manual reset event object by using the [CreateEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-createeventa) function. It is critical that the event object be manual rather than auto-reset. The use of auto-reset events in overlapped I/O can lead to an unrecoverable lack of response in the I/O processing operation.
* Save the handle of this event in the **hEvent** member of the **OVERLAPPED** structure.

When you implement [SensorAdapterDetach](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/nc-winbio_adapter-pibio_sensor_detach_fn), you must release the event object by calling the [CloseHandle](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) function. It is important not to release this handle until after all input and output operations related to the capture have been completed or canceled.

The Windows Biometric Framework uses the **OVERLAPPED** object when it calls operating system functions such as [GetOverlappedResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-getoverlappedresult) and [WaitForMultipleObjects](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/synchapi/nf-synchapi-waitformultipleobjects) to determine when the capture operation has completed.

The event handle in the **OVERLAPPED** structure must be in the non-signaled state when *SensorAdapterStartCapture* returns. Calling [DeviceIoControl](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ioapiset/nf-ioapiset-deviceiocontrol) to start an overlapped I/O operation automatically resets the event. If your adapter uses some other mechanism to start an I/O operation, you must reset the event yourself.

The Windows Biometric Framework guarantees that only one asynchronous I/O operation is outstanding at any time for each biometric unit. Consequently, the sensor adapter only needs one **OVERLAPPED** structure for each processing pipeline.

The Windows Biometric Framework opens and closes the sensor adapter handle and is responsible for ensuring that the handle has been configured for overlapped I/O.

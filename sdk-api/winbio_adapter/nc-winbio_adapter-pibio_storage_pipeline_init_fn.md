# PIBIO_STORAGE_PIPELINE_INIT_FN callback function

## Description

Called by the Windows Biometric Framework to give the Storage Adapter the chance to perform any initialization that remains incomplete.

## Parameters

### `Pipeline` [in, out]

Pointer to the [WINBIO_PIPELINE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/ns-winbio_adapter-winbio_pipeline) structure associated with the biometric unit performing the operation.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. If the function fails, it must return one of the following **HRESULT** values to indicate the error.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_some_error** | Any error code will cause the Biometric Service to log the error and abort the configuration of the biometric unit. |

## Remarks

The Storage Adapter should return **S_OK** if it doesnâ€™t need to perform any initialization at this point.

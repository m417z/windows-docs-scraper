## Remarks

An Engine Adapter that maintains a private in-memory cache of templates (e.g., for performance reasons) should discard the contents of its cache when it receives this method call. The call indicates that the cache contents are no longer valid. Depending on the Engine Adapterâ€™s cache policy, the adapter may also choose to reload its cache at this time from the template database.

The biometric service calls this method in the following situations:

* Once, when the [StorageAdapterAttach](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/nc-winbio_adapter-pibio_storage_attach_fn) routine has successfully opened its connection to the template database.
* Again, after performing any operation that changes the state of the template database.
  + Adding a new template to the database.
  + Deleting one or more existing templates from the database.

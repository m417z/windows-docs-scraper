# PIBIO_STORAGE_CONTROL_UNIT_PRIVILEGED_FN callback function

## Description

Called by the Windows Biometric Framework to perform a vendor-defined control operation that requires elevated privilege. Call the [StorageAdapterControlUnit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/nc-winbio_adapter-pibio_storage_control_unit_fn) function to perform a vendor-defined control operation that does not require elevated privilege.

## Parameters

### `Pipeline` [in, out]

A pointer to the [WINBIO_PIPELINE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/ns-winbio_adapter-winbio_pipeline) structure associated with the biometric unit performing the operation.

### `ControlCode` [in]

A **ULONG** value that specifies the vendor-defined operation to perform.

### `SendBuffer` [in]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the control information sent to the storage adapter. The format and content of the buffer is vendor defined.

### `SendBufferSize` [in]

The size, in bytes, of the buffer specified by the *SendBuffer* parameter.

### `ReceiveBuffer` [in]

A pointer to a buffer that receives information returned by the storage adapter in response to the control operation. The format of the buffer is vendor defined.

### `ReceiveBufferSize` [in]

The size, in bytes, of the buffer specified by the *ReceiveBuffer* parameter.

### `ReceiveDataSize` [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives the size, in bytes, of the data written to the buffer specified by the *ReceiveBuffer* parameter.

### `OperationStatus` [out]

A pointer to a variable that receives a vendor-defined status code that specifies the outcome of the control operation.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. If the function fails, it must return one of the following **HRESULT** values to indicate the error.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_POINTER** | A mandatory pointer argument is **NULL**. |
| ****E_INVALIDARG**** | The size or format of the buffer specified by the *SendBuffer* parameter is not correct, or the value specified in the *ControlCode* parameter is not recognized by the adapter. |
| **E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER** | The buffer specified by the *ReceiveBuffer* parameter is too small. |
| **WINBIO_E_CANCELED** | The operation was canceled. |
| **WINBIO_E_DEVICE_FAILURE** | There was a hardware failure. |
| ****WINBIO_E_INVALID_CONTROL_CODE**** | The value specified in the *ControlCode* parameter is not recognized by the adapter.<br><br>**Note** Beginning with Windows 8, use only **E_INVALIDARG** to signal this condition. |

## Remarks

Your implementation of this function should be identical to your implementation of the [StorageAdapterControlUnit](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio_adapter/nc-winbio_adapter-pibio_storage_control_unit_fn) function except that elevated privileges are required to perform the operations specified by the *ControlCode* parameter. You are responsible for defining the operations and deciding which will require elevated privilege.

This function must check the value of the *ReceiveBufferSize* parameter to be certain that the buffer specified by the *ReceiveBuffer* parameter is large enough to hold the data being returned.

#### Examples

The following pseudocode shows one possible implementation of this function. The example does not compile. You must adapt it to suit your purpose.

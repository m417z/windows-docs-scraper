# IBackgroundCopyJob::SetMinimumRetryDelay

## Description

Sets the minimum length of time that BITS waits after encountering a transient error condition before trying to transfer the file.

## Parameters

### `Seconds` [in]

Minimum length of time, in seconds, that BITS waits after encountering a transient error before trying to transfer the file. The default retry delay is 600 seconds (10 minutes). The minimum retry delay that you can specify is 5 seconds. If you specify a value less than 5 seconds, BITS changes the value to 5 seconds. If the value exceeds the no-progress-timeout
value retrieved from the [GetNoProgressTimeout](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/bits/nf-bits-ibackgroundcopyjob-getprogress) method, BITS will not retry the transfer and moves the job to the BG_JOB_STATE_ERROR state.

## Return value

This method returns the following **HRESULT** values, as well as others.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****S_OK**** | Retry delay was successfully set. |
| **BG_E_INVALID_STATE** | The state of the job cannot be BG_JOB_STATE_CANCELLED or BG_JOB_STATE_ACKNOWLEDGED. |

## Remarks

To start the job before the minimum retry period expires, call the [IBackgroundCopyJob::Resume](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/bits/nf-bits-ibackgroundcopyjob-resume) method.

BITS does not retry the job if a network disconnect or disk lock error occurred (for example, chkdsk is running) or the [MaxInternetBandwidth](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Bits/group-policies) Group Policy is zero.

**Note** Changing the system clock does not affect the minimum retry delay. For example, if the current time is 2:00 P.M. and BITS is to retry the job at 2:10 P.M., moving the system clock forward ten or more minutes does not mean BITS will retry the job earlyâ€”BITS will still retry the job in ten minutes. To reflect the system clock change in BITS, you must restart the computer or the BITS service.

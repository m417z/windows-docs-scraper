# CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME structure

## Description

The **CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME** structure identifies a location from which the CRL can be obtained. When **CRL_DIST_POINT_NAME** is used, different forms of the CRL distribution point name appear in the **FullName** member of the [CERT_ALT_NAME_INFO](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/ns-wincrypt-cert_alt_name_info) structure. An application need not be able to process all of the name forms in the structure. It can use a distribution point if at least one name form can be processed.

If no name forms for a distribution point can be processed, an application can still use the certificate, provided requisite revocation information can be obtained from another source such as a distribution point of the [certification authority's](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly) (CA's) directory entry.

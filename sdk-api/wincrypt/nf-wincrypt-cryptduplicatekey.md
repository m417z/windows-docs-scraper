# CryptDuplicateKey function

## Description

**Important** This API is deprecated. New and existing software should start using [Cryptography Next Generation APIs.](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCNG/cng-portal) Microsoft may remove this API in future releases.

The **CryptDuplicateKey** function makes an exact copy of a key and the [state](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) of the key.

## Parameters

### `hKey` [in]

A handle to the key to be duplicated.

### `pdwReserved` [in]

Reserved for future use and must be **NULL**.

### `dwFlags` [in]

Reserved for future use and must be zero.

### `phKey` [out]

Address of the handle to the duplicated key. When you have finished using the key, release the handle by calling the [CryptDestroyKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdestroykey) function.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero (TRUE).

If the function fails, the return value is zero (FALSE). For extended error information, call
[GetLastError](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

The error code prefaced by "NTE" is generated by the particular CSP being used. Some possible error codes are listed in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED** | Because this is a new function, existing CSPs might not implement it. This error is returned if the CSP does not support this function. |
| **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER** | One of the parameters contains a value that is not valid. This is most often a pointer that is not valid. |
| **NTE_BAD_KEY** | A handle to the original key is not valid. |

## Remarks

**CryptDuplicateKey** makes a copy of a key and the exact [state](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly) of the key. One scenario when this function can be used is when an application needs to encrypt two separate messages with the same key but with different [salt values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/s-gly). The original key is generated and then a duplicate key is made by using the **CryptDuplicateKey** function. The different salt values are then set on the original and duplicate keys with separate calls to the
[CryptSetKeyParam](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptsetkeyparam) function.

[CryptDestroyKey](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptdestroykey) must be called to destroy any keys that are created by using **CryptDuplicateKey**. Destroying the original key does not cause the duplicate key to be destroyed. After a duplicate key is made, it is separate from the original key. There is no shared state between the two keys.

#### Examples

The following example shows the creation of a session key that is a duplicate of an existing session key. For an example that includes the complete context for this example, see [Example C Program: Duplicating a Session Key](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/example-c-program-duplicating-a-session-key).

```cpp
//--------------------------------------------------------------------
// Declare and initialize variables.

HCRYPTKEY    hDuplicateKey;

// Duplicate the key. hOriginalKey is a previously
// assigned HCRYPTKEY variable.

if (CryptDuplicateKey(
     hOriginalKey,
     NULL,
     0,
     &hDuplicateKey))
{
   printf("The session key has been duplicated. \n");
}
else
{
   printf("Error using CryptDuplicateKey.\n");
   exit(1);
}

// Insert code that uses the duplicate key here.

// When you have finished using the key, the handle must be released.

if (CryptDestroyKey(hDuplicateKey))
{
  printf("The handle has been released.\n");
}
else
{
  printf("The handle could not be released.\n");
}
```

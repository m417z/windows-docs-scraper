# PUBLICKEYSTRUC structure

## Description

The **PUBLICKEYSTRUC** structure, also known as the **BLOBHEADER** structure, indicates a key's [BLOB](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/b-gly) type and the algorithm that the key uses. One of these structures is located at the beginning of the **pbData** member of every [key BLOB](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/k-gly).

This structure is not limited to the key BLOBs generated by the PROV_RSA_BASE and PROV_RSA_SIG provider types. The **pbData** member of any new key BLOB type must begin with this structure.

## Members

### `bType`

Contains the key BLOB type.

The following are the predefined values for this member. [Cryptographic service providers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/c-gly) (CSPs) can use other type identifiers as needed.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **KEYSTATEBLOB**<br><br>0xC | The BLOB is a key state BLOB. |
| **OPAQUEKEYBLOB**<br><br>0x9 | The key is a session key. |
| **PLAINTEXTKEYBLOB**<br><br>0x8 | The key is a session key. |
| **PRIVATEKEYBLOB**<br><br>0x7 | The key is a [public/private key pair](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/p-gly). |
| **PUBLICKEYBLOB**<br><br>0x6 | The key is a public key. |
| **PUBLICKEYBLOBEX**<br><br>0xA | The key is a public key. |
| **SIMPLEBLOB**<br><br>0x1 | The key is a session key. |
| **SYMMETRICWRAPKEYBLOB**<br><br>0xB | The key is a symmetric key. |

### `bVersion`

Contains the version number of the key BLOB format. For example, if the BLOB is a [Digital Signature Standard](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecGloss/d-gly) (DSS) version 3 key, this member will contain 3. The minimum value for this member is defined by the **CUR_BLOB_VERSION** (2) identifier.

### `reserved`

This member is reserved for future use and must be set to zero.

### `aiKeyAlg`

Contains one of the [ALG_ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/alg-id) values that identifies the algorithm of the key contained by the key BLOB.

Not all algorithm identifiers are valid with all BLOB types. For example, since an RC4 key is a session key, it cannot be exported into a PUBLICKEYBLOB.

PLAINTEXTBLOBs can be used with any algorithm or type of key combination supported by the CSP in use. Note that a 3DES key cannot be imported when the Microsoft Base Provider is in use.

# DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SOURCE_INFO structure

## Description

The DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SOURCE_INFO structure contains source information for a single path.

## Members

### `adapterId`

The identifier of the adapter that this source information relates to.

### `id`

The source identifier on the specified adapter that this path relates to.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME`

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.modeInfoIdx`

A valid index into the mode information table that contains the source mode information for this path only when DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SUPPORT_VIRTUAL_MODE is not set. If source mode information is not available, the value of **modeInfoIdx** is DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_MODE_IDX_INVALID.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME`

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.cloneGroupId`

A valid identifier used to show which clone group the path is a member of only when DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SUPPORT_VIRTUAL_MODE is set. If this value is invalid, then it must be set to DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_CLONE_GROUP_INVALID.

**cloneGroupId** is only used when the source mode index is not specified. Two such scenarios are when the source mode info must be invalid because SDC_TOPOLOGY_SUPPLIED is used, and when SDC_USE_SUPPLIED_DISPLAY_CONFIG is used with paths that do not have source mode info. The **cloneGroupId** will be used to indicate which paths are in a clone group, all the paths with the same **cloneGroupId** value are considered in the same clone group. There is no requirement that the clone group idâ€™s have to be zero based or contiguous. Supported starting in Windows 10.

### `DUMMYUNIONNAME.DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.sourceModeInfoIdx`

A valid index into the mode array of the [DISPLAYCONFIG_SOURCE_MODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-displayconfig_source_mode) entry that contains the source mode information for this path only when DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SUPPORT_VIRTUAL_MODE is set. If there is no entry for this in the mode array, the value of **sourceModeInfoIdx** is DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SOURCE_MODE_IDX_INVALID. Supported starting in Windows 10.

### `statusFlags`

A bitwise OR of flag values that indicates the status of the source. The following values are supported:

#### DISPLAYCONFIG_SOURCE_IN_USE

This source is in use by at least one active path.

## Remarks

A DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SOURCE_INFO structure is specified in the **sourceInfo** member of a [DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_INFO](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/ns-wingdi-displayconfig_path_info) structure.

A source corresponds to a surface on which the display adapter can render pixels. Each display adapter is capable of rendering to x number of sources. What this means is how many desktops can be rendered for extend mode. This is typically 2. For example, source 0 might be rendering pixels from 0,0 to 1024,768, and source 1 might be rendering pixels from 1025,0 to 2048, 768.

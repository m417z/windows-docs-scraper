# EMRGLSBOUNDEDRECORD structure

## Description

The **EMRGLSBOUNDEDRECORD** structure contains members for an enhanced metafile record generated by OpenGL functions. It contains data for OpenGL functions with information in pixel units that must be scaled when playing the metafile.

## Members

### `emr`

The base structure for all record types.

### `rclBounds`

Bounds of the rectangle, in device coordinates, within which to perform the OpenGL function. For more information, see Remarks.

### `cbData`

Size of *Data*, in bytes.

### `Data`

Array of data representing the OpenGL function to be performed.

## Remarks

The coordinates in **rclBounds** are in OpenGL pixel coordinates, which generally equate to window coordinates.
For example, if the [glBitmap](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/OpenGL/glbitmap) function has width1 and height1, the bounds will be 0, 0, width1, height1.

## Return value

The return value specifies the value of the desired item.

When *nIndex* is BITSPIXEL and the device has 15bpp or 16bpp, the return value is 16.

## Remarks

When *nIndex* is SHADEBLENDCAPS:

* For a printer, **GetDeviceCaps** returns whatever the printer reports.
* For a display device, all blending operations are available; besides SB_NONE, the only return values are SB_CONST_ALPHA and SB_PIXEL_ALPHA, which indicate whether these operations are accelerated.

On a multiple monitor system, if *hdc* is the desktop, **GetDeviceCaps** returns the capabilities of the primary monitor. If you want info for other monitors, you must use the [multi-monitor APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/gdi/multiple-display-monitors-reference) or [CreateDC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wingdi/nf-wingdi-createdca) to get a HDC for the device context (DC) of a specific monitor.

**Note** Display1 is typically the primary monitor, but not always.

**GetDeviceCaps** provides the following six indexes in place of printer escapes.

| Index | Printer escape replaced |
| --- | --- |
| PHYSICALWIDTH | GETPHYSPAGESIZE |
| PHYSICALHEIGHT | GETPHYSPAGESIZE |
| PHYSICALOFFSETX | GETPRINTINGOFFSET |
| PHYSICALOFFSETY | GETPHYSICALOFFSET |
| SCALINGFACTORX | GETSCALINGFACTOR |
| SCALINGFACTORY | GETSCALINGFACTOR |

**Note** **GetDeviceCaps** reports info that the display driver provides. If the display driver declines to report any info, **GetDeviceCaps** calculates the info based on fixed calculations. If the display driver reports invalid info, **GetDeviceCaps** returns the invalid info. Also, if the display driver declines to report info, **GetDeviceCaps** might calculate incorrect info because it assumes either fixed DPI (96 DPI) or a fixed size (depending on the info that the display driver did and didn’t provide). Unfortunately, a display driver that is implemented to the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) (introduced in Windows Vista) causes GDI to not get the info, so **GetDeviceCaps** must always calculate the info.

# IAMVideoAcceleratorNotify::SetUncompSurfacesInfo

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **SetUncompSurfacesInfo** method notifies the decoder of how many uncompressed surfaces were created.

## Parameters

### `dwActualUncompSurfacesAllocated` [in]

The number of surfaces allocated.

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value that depends on the implementation of the interface. **HRESULT** can include one of the following standard constants, or other values not listed.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_FAIL** | Failure. |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | Argument is invalid. |
| **E_NOTIMPL** | Method is not supported. |
| **E_POINTER** | **NULL** pointer argument. |
| **S_OK** | Success. |

## Remarks

The video renderer calls this method after it allocates uncompressed surfaces for video decoding.

# DdSwapTextureHandles function

## Description

[This function is subject to change with each operating system revision. Instead, use the Microsoft DirectDraw and Microsoft Direct3DAPIs; these APIs insulate applications from such operating system changes, and hide many other difficulties involved in interacting directly with display drivers.]

Developed for device driver interfaces (DDIs) prior to Microsoft DirectDraw 7.0 and does nothing on Microsoft Windows NT systems. All parameters are ignored.

**GdiEntry16** is defined as an alias for this function.

## Parameters

### `pDDraw`

Reserved.

### `pDDSLcl1`

Reserved.

### `pDDSLcl2`

Reserved.

## Return value

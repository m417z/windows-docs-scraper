# IMediaPosition::put_Rate

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The put_Rate method sets the playback rate.

## Parameters

### `dRate` [in]

Playback rate. Must not be zero.

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value. Possible values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | Invalid argument. |
| **E_NOTIMPL** | Not implemented. |

## Remarks

The playback rate is expressed as a ratio of the normal speed. Thus, 1.0 is normal playback speed, 0.5 is half speed, and 2.0 is twice speed. For audio streams, changing the rate also changes the pitch.

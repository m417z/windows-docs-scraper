# IMediaPosition::get_CurrentPosition

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `get_CurrentPosition` method retrieves the current position, relative to the total duration of the stream.

## Parameters

### `pllTime` [out]

Pointer to a variable that receives the current position, in seconds.

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value. Possible values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **E_NOTIMPL** | Not implemented. |
| **E_POINTER** | **NULL** pointer argument. |

## Remarks

This method returns the current position that playback has reached. The value includes adjustments for the playback rate and starting time. For example, if the start time is 5 seconds, the playback rate is 2.0, and you run the graph for four seconds, the current position is 5 + (4 x 2.0) = 13.0 seconds.

If the graph is paused or stopped, the current position is the point at which playback will resume.

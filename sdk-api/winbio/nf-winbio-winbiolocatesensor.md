# WinBioLocateSensor function

## Description

Retrieves the ID number of a biometric unit selected interactively by a user.

## Parameters

### `SessionHandle` [in]

A **WINBIO_SESSION_HANDLE** value that identifies an open biometric session. Open a synchronous session handle by calling [WinBioOpenSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioopensession). Open an asynchronous session handle by calling [WinBioAsyncOpenSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioasyncopensession).

### `UnitId` [out, optional]

A pointer to a **ULONG** value that specifies the biometric unit.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. If the function fails, it returns an **HRESULT** value that indicates the error. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table. For a list of common error codes, see [Common HRESULT Values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SecCrypto/common-hresult-values).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_HANDLE** | The session handle is not valid. |
| **E_POINTER** | The pointer specified by the *UnitId* parameter cannot be **NULL**. |
| **WINBIO_E_ENROLLMENT_IN_PROGRESS** | The operation could not be completed because the biometric unit is currently being used for an enrollment transaction (system pool only). |

## Remarks

You can use this function on systems with multiple sensors to determine which sensor is preferred for enrollment by the user. No identification information is returned by this function. It is provided only to indicate user sensor selection.

Calls to this function using the system pool will block until the application acquires window focus and the user has provided a biometric sample. We recommend, therefore, that your application not call **WinBioLocateSensor** until it has acquired focus. The manner in which you acquire focus depends on the type of application you are writing. For example, if you are creating a GUI application you can implement a message handler that captures a WM_ACTIVATE, WM_SETFOCUS, or other appropriate message. If you are writing a CUI application, call **GetConsoleWindow** to retrieve a handle to the console window and pass that handle to the **SetForegroundWindow** function to force the console window into the foreground and assign it focus. If your application is running in a detached process and has no window or is a Windows service, use [WinBioAcquireFocus](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioacquirefocus) and [WinBioReleaseFocus](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioreleasefocus) to manually control focus.

To use **WinBioLocateSensor** synchronously, call the function with a session handle created by calling [WinBioOpenSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioopensession). The function blocks until the operation completes or an error is encountered.

To use **WinBioLocateSensor** asynchronously, call the function with a session handle created by calling [WinBioAsyncOpenSession](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbioasyncopensession). The framework allocates a [WINBIO_ASYNC_RESULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/ns-winbio-winbio_async_result) structure and uses it to return information about operation success or failure. The **WINBIO_ASYNC_RESULT** structure is returned to the application callback or to the application message queue, depending on the value you set in the *NotificationMethod* parameter of the **WinBioAsyncOpenSession** function:

* If you choose to receive completion notices by using a callback, you must implement a [PWINBIO_ASYNC_COMPLETION_CALLBACK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nc-winbio-pwinbio_async_completion_callback) function and set the *NotificationMethod* parameter to **WINBIO_ASYNC_NOTIFY_CALLBACK**.
* If you choose to receive completion notices by using the application message queue, you must set the *NotificationMethod* parameter to **WINBIO_ASYNC_NOTIFY_MESSAGE**. The framework returns a [WINBIO_ASYNC_RESULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/ns-winbio-winbio_async_result) pointer to the **LPARAM** field of the window message.

To prevent memory leaks, you must call [WinBioFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbiofree) to release the [WINBIO_ASYNC_RESULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/ns-winbio-winbio_async_result) structure after you have finished using it.

**Windows 7:** You can perform this operation asynchronously by using the [WinBioLocateSensorWithCallback](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nf-winbio-winbiolocatesensorwithcallback) function. The function verifies the input arguments and returns immediately. If the input arguments are not valid, the function returns an error code. Otherwise, the framework starts the operation on another thread. When the asynchronous operation completes or encounters an error, the framework sends the results to the [PWINBIO_LOCATE_SENSOR_CALLBACK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbio/nc-winbio-pwinbio_locate_sensor_callback) function implemented by your application.

#### Examples

The following function calls **WinBioLocateSensor** to locate an installed
biometric sensor. Link to the Winbio.lib static library and include the following header files:

* Windows.h
* Stdio.h
* Conio.h
* Winbio.h

```cpp
HRESULT LocateSensor( )
{
    HRESULT hr = S_OK;
    WINBIO_SESSION_HANDLE sessionHandle = NULL;
    WINBIO_UNIT_ID unitId = 0;

    // Connect to the system pool.
    hr = WinBioOpenSession(
            WINBIO_TYPE_FINGERPRINT,    // Service provider
            WINBIO_POOL_SYSTEM,         // Pool type
            WINBIO_FLAG_DEFAULT,        // Configuration and access
            NULL,                       // Array of biometric unit IDs
            0,                          // Count of biometric unit IDs
            NULL,                       // Database ID
            &sessionHandle              // [out] Session handle
            );
    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        wprintf_s(L"\n WinBioEnumBiometricUnits failed. hr = 0x%x\n", hr);
        goto e_Exit;
    }

    // Locate the sensor.
    wprintf_s(L"\n Tap the sensor once...\n");
    hr = WinBioLocateSensor( sessionHandle, &unitId);
    if (FAILED(hr))
    {
        wprintf_s(L"\n WinBioLocateSensor failed. hr = 0x%x\n", hr);
        goto e_Exit;
    }
    wprintf_s(L"\n Sensor located successfully. ");
    wprintf_s(L"\n Unit ID = %d \n", unitId);

e_Exit:
    if (sessionHandle != NULL)
    {
        WinBioCloseSession(sessionHandle);
        sessionHandle = NULL;
    }

    wprintf_s(L"\n Hit any key to exit...");
    _getch();

    return hr;
}

```

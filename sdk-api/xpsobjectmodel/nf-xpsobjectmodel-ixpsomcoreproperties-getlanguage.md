# IXpsOMCoreProperties::GetLanguage

## Description

Gets the **language** property.

## Parameters

### `language` [out, retval]

The value that is read from the **language** property.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the table that follows. For information about XPS document API return values that are not listed in this table, see [XPS Document Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | *language* is **NULL**. |

## Remarks

The **language** property describes the language of the resource's intellectual content.

Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) RFC 3066 describes the recommended encoding for this property.

This method allocates the memory used by the string that is returned in *language*. If *language* is not **NULL**, use the [CoTaskMemFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree) function to free the memory.

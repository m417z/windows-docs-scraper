# IXpsOMDocumentSequence::GetPrintTicketResource

## Description

Gets the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface to the job-level print ticket that is assigned to the document sequence.

## Parameters

### `printTicketResource` [out, retval]

A pointer to the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface of the job-level print ticket that is assigned to the document sequence. If no **IXpsOMPrintTicketResource** interface has been assigned to the document sequence, a **NULL** pointer is returned.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the table that follows. For information about XPS document API return values that are not listed in this table, see [XPS Document Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | *printTicketResource* is **NULL**. |

## Remarks

After loading and parsing the resource into the XPS OM, this method might return an error that applies to another resource. This occurs because all of the relationships are parsed when a resource is loaded.

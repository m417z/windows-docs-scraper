# IXpsOMPageReference::GetPrintTicketResource

## Description

Gets a pointer to the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface of the page-level print ticket resource that is associated with the page.

## Parameters

### `printTicketResource` [out, retval]

A pointer to the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface of the page-level print ticket resource that is associated with the page. If no print ticket resource has been set, a **NULL** pointer is returned.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the table that follows. For information about XPS document API return values that are not listed in this table, see [XPS Document Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | *printTicketResource* is **NULL**. |

This method calls the [Packaging](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/packaging) API. For information about the Packaging API return values, see [Packaging Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/opc/packaging-errors).

## Remarks

After loading and parsing the resource into the XPS OM, this method might return an error that applies to another resource. This occurs because all of the relationships are parsed when a resource is loaded.

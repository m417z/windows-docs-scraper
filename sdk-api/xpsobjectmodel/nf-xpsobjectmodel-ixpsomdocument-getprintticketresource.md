# IXpsOMDocument::GetPrintTicketResource

## Description

Gets the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface of the document-level print ticket.

## Parameters

### `printTicketResource` [out, retval]

A pointer to the [IXpsOMPrintTicketResource](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/xpsobjectmodel/nn-xpsobjectmodel-ixpsomprintticketresource) interface of the document-level print ticket that is associated with the document. If no print ticket has been assigned, a **NULL** pointer will be returned.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the table that follows. For information about XPS document API return values that are not listed in this table, see [XPS Document Errors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/dd372955(v=vs.85)).

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | *printTicketResource* is **NULL**. |

## Remarks

After loading and parsing the resource into the XPS OM, this method might return an error that applies to another resource. This occurs because all of the relationships are parsed when a resource is loaded.

# D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP enumeration

## Description

Identifiers for properties of the [Distant-specular lighting effect](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Direct2D/distant-specular).

## Constants

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_AZIMUTH:0`

The direction angle of the light source in the XY plane relative to the X-axis in the counter clock wise direction. The units are in degrees and must be between 0 and 360 degrees.

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 0.0f.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_ELEVATION:1`

The direction angle of the light source in the YZ plane relative to the Y-axis in the counter clock wise direction. The units are in degrees and must be between 0 and 360 degrees.

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 0.0f.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_SPECULAR_EXPONENT:2`

The exponent for the specular term in the Phong lighting equation. A larger value corresponds to a more reflective surface. The value is unitless and must be between 1.0 and 128.

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 1.0f.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_SPECULAR_CONSTANT:3`

The ratio of specular reflection to the incoming light. The value is unitless and must be between 0 and 10,000.

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 1.0f.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_SURFACE_SCALE:4`

The scale factor in the Z direction. The value is unitless and must be between 0 and 10,000.

The type is FLOAT.

The default value is 1.0f.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_COLOR:5`

The color of the incoming light. This property is exposed as a D2D1_VECTOR_3F â€“ (R, G, B) and used to compute LR, LG, LB.

The type is D2D1_VECTOR_3F.

The default value is {1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f}.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_KERNEL_UNIT_LENGTH:6`

The size of an element in the Sobel kernel used to generate the surface normal in the X and Y direction. This property is a D2D1_VECTOR_2F (Kernel Unit Length X, Kernel Unit Length Y) and is defined in (device-independent pixels (DIPs)/Kernel Unit). The effect uses bilinear interpolation to scale the bitmap to match size of kernel elements.

The type is D2D1_VECTOR_2F.

The default value is {1.0f, 1.0f}.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_SCALE_MODE:7`

The interpolation mode the effect uses to scale the image to the corresponding kernel unit length. There are six scale modes that range in quality and speed.

The type is D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_SCALE_MODE.

The default value is D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_SCALE_MODE_LINEAR.

### `D2D1_DISTANTSPECULAR_PROP_FORCE_DWORD:0xffffffff`

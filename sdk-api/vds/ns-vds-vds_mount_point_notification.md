## Remarks

The [VDS_NOTIFICATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/ns-vdshwprv-vds_notification) structure includes this
structure as a member.

An application can receive these event notifications by implementing the
[IVdsAdviseSink](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nn-vdshwprv-ivdsadvisesink) interface and passing the interface
pointer as an argument to the [IVdsService::Advise](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vds/nf-vds-ivdsservice-advise)
method.

# IVdsOpenVDisk::Expand

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Increases the size of a virtual disk to the maximum size available on a fixed or expandable disk.

## Parameters

### `Flags` [in]

An **EXPAND_VIRTUAL_DISK_FLAG** enumeration value that specifies how the virtual disk is to be expanded. Must be set to EXPAND_VIRTUAL_DISK_FLAG_NONE.

### `NewSize` [in]

The desired size in bytes of the expanded virtual disk.

### `ppAsync` [out]

A pointer to an [IVdsAsync](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nn-vdshwprv-ivdsasync) interface that upon successful completion receives the **IVdsAsync** interface to monitor and control this operation. Callers must release the interface received when they have finished with it. If the [IVdsAsync::Wait](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdsasync-wait) method is called on the interface and a success HRESULT value is returned, the interfaces returned in the [VDS_ASYNC_OUTPUT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/ns-vdshwprv-vds_async_output) structure must be released by calling the [IUnknown::Release](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release) method on each interface pointer. However, if **Wait** returns a failure HRESULT value, or if the *pHrResult* parameter of **Wait** receives a failure HRESULT value, the interface pointers in the **VDS_ASYNC_OUTPUT** structure are **NULL** and do not need to be released. You can test for success or failure HRESULT values by using the [SUCCEEDED](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) and [FAILED](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macros defined in Winerror.h.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_INVALIDARG or E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method completed successfully. |

## Remarks

A virtual disk can be expanded only if it is detached.

The virtual disk must have been opened with access to perform metadata operations. This corresponds to the **VIRTUAL_DISK_ACCESS_METAOPS** value of the [VIRTUAL_DISK_ACCESS_MASK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/virtdisk/ne-virtdisk-virtual_disk_access_mask-r1) enumeration.

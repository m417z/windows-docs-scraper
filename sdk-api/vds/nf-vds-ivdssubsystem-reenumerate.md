# IVdsSubSystem::Reenumerate

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Prompts the
subsystem to scan its bus to discover newly-connected drives or newly-disconnected drives.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VDS_E_PROVIDER_CACHE_CORRUPT**<br><br>0x8004241FL | This return value signals a software or communication problem inside a provider that caches information about the array. Use the [IVdsHwProvider::Reenumerate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-reenumerate) method followed by the [IVdsHwProvider::Refresh](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-refresh) method to restore the cache. |
| **VDS_E_OBJECT_DELETED**<br><br>0x8004240BL | The subsystem object is no longer present. |
| **VDS_E_OBJECT_STATUS_FAILED**<br><br>0x80042431L | The subsystem is in a failed state and is unable to perform the requested operation. |
| **VDS_E_ANOTHER_CALL_IN_PROGRESS**<br><br>0x80042404L | Another operation is in progress; this operation cannot proceed until the previous operation or operations are complete. |

## Remarks

Most subsystems detect new connections and disconnections automatically. However, for those that do not, this
method provides a means by which to initiate detection manually. This operation can take a long time to complete.

When this method detects a newly connected drive, the provider creates a new drive object for it. When the
method detects a newly disconnected drive, the provider preserves the old drive object until its last VDS
reference is removed, and then deletes the object.

Each object should have a unique and persistent identifier. An object ID must be a valid GUID. Implementers
should persist an object ID across each reenumeration by using this method for objects that exist both before and
after the reenumeration.

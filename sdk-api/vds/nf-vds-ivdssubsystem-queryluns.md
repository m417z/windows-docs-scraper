# IVdsSubSystem::QueryLuns

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Returns an
enumeration of LUNs surfaced in the subsystem. This method applies to hardware provider objects only.

## Parameters

### `ppEnum` [out]

The address of an [IEnumVdsObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nn-vdshwprv-ienumvdsobject) interface
pointer that can be used to enumerate the LUNs as [LUN objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/lun-object). For more information, see [Working with Enumeration Objects](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/working-with-enumeration-objects). Callers must release the interface and each of the LUN objects when they are no longer needed by calling the [IUnknown::Release](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/unknwn/nf-unknwn-iunknown-release) method.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_INVALIDARG or E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | Returns the enumeration of LUNs in the subsystem. If the subsystem has no LUNs, the enumeration is empty. |
| **VDS_E_PROVIDER_CACHE_CORRUPT**<br><br>0x8004241FL | This return value signals a software or communication problem inside a provider that caches information about the array. Use the [IVdsHwProvider::Reenumerate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-reenumerate) method followed by the [IVdsHwProvider::Refresh](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-refresh) method to restore the cache. |
| **VDS_E_OBJECT_DELETED**<br><br>0x8004240BL | The subsystem object is no longer present. |
| **VDS_E_OBJECT_STATUS_FAILED**<br><br>0x80042431L | The subsystem is in a failed state and is unable to perform the requested operation. |
| **VDS_E_ANOTHER_CALL_IN_PROGRESS**<br><br>0x80042404L | Another operation is in progress; this operation cannot proceed until the previous operation or operations are complete. |

## Remarks

The [IEnumVdsObject](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nn-vdshwprv-ienumvdsobject) interface
includes all LUNs in the subsystem, regardless of LUN masking.

Implementers must return an empty enumeration object for each subsystem with zero LUNs.

If this method is called in two separate threads that are running simultaneously, the results may be inconsistent. If it is called in one thread while a method such as [IVdsLun::Delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdslun-delete) is called in another thread that is running simultaneously, the result could be a provider access violation. The hardware provider is responsible for serializing this query operation as needed to minimize such synchronization issues.

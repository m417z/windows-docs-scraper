# IVdsHbaPort::GetProperties

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Retrieves the properties of an HBA port.

## Parameters

### `pHbaPortProp` [out]

The address of a member of the [VDS_HBAPORT_PROP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/ns-vdshwprv-vds_hbaport_prop) structure
that is allocated and passed in by the caller.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_INVALIDARG or E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****S_OK**** | The properties were successfully returned. |
| ****VDS_S_PROPERTIES_INCOMPLETE****<br><br>0x00042715L | Some but not all of the properties were successfully retrieved. Note that there are many possible reasons for failing to retrieve all properties, including device removal. |
| ****E_POINTER**** | The *pHbaPortProp* parameter is not a valid pointer. |

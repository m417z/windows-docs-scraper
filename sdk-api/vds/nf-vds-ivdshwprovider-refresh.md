# IVdsHwProvider::Refresh

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Refreshes VDS's
internally cached data about existing subsystems that are managed by VDS providers.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **VDS_E_PROVIDER_CACHE_CORRUPT**<br><br>0x8004241FL | This return value signals a software or communication problem inside a provider that caches information about the array. Use the [IVdsHwProvider::Reenumerate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-reenumerate) method followed by the [IVdsHwProvider::Refresh](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-refresh) method to restore the cache. |
| **VDS_E_OBJECT_STATUS_FAILED**<br><br>0x80042431L | The provider is in a failed state, and is unable to perform the requested operation. |
| **VDS_E_ANOTHER_CALL_IN_PROGRESS**<br><br>0x80042404L | Another operation is in progress; this operation cannot proceed until the previous operation or operations are complete. |
| **VDS_E_INITIALIZE_NOT_CALLED**<br><br>0x80042402L | The initialization method has not been called. |

## Remarks

VDS maintains a cache of information about the properties of all VDS objects, such as subsystems and controllers. Whenever a change occurs that triggers a notification, this cache is updated. In cases where the cache is not being updated properly, applications can call this method to refresh the cache. Note that calling this method to refresh the cache can in turn trigger additional notifications.

This method does not query the network to find newly connected subsystems. To discover newly connected and
disconnected subsystems, use the
[IVdsHwProvider::Reenumerate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-reenumerate) method.

# IVdsIscsiTarget::GetConnectedInitiators

## Description

[Beginning with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, the [Virtual Disk Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-portal) COM interface is superseded by the [Windows Storage Management API](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/storage/windows-storage-management-api-portal).]

Returns the list of iSCSI names of the initiators currently logged into the
target.

## Parameters

### `pppwszInitiatorList` [out]

The address of a variable that receives an array of strings containing the iSCSI names of the initiators currently logged into the
target. Callers must free each string in this array, as well as the array itself, by using the
[CoTaskMemFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree) function.

### `plNumberOfInitiators` [out]

A pointer to the number of strings returned in *pppwszInitiatorList*.

## Return value

This method can return standard HRESULT values, such as E_INVALIDARG or E_OUTOFMEMORY, and [VDS-specific return values](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/virtual-disk-service-common-return-codes). It can also return converted [system error codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Debug/system-error-codes) using the [HRESULT_FROM_WIN32](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-hresult_from_win32) macro. Errors can originate from VDS itself or from the underlying [VDS provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/VDS/about-vds) that is being used. Possible return values include the following.

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****S_OK**** | The list of connected initiators was returned successfully. |
| ****VDS_E_ANOTHER_CALL_IN_PROGRESS****<br><br>0x80042404L | Another operation is in progress; this operation cannot proceed until the previous operations are complete. |
| ****VDS_E_PROVIDER_CACHE_CORRUPT****<br><br>0x8004241FL | The cache of the provider is corrupted. This indicates a software or communication problem inside a provider that caches information about the attached devices. The caller can use the [IVdsHwProvider::Reenumerate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-reenumerate) method followed by the [IVdsHwProvider::Refresh](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vdshwprv/nf-vdshwprv-ivdshwprovider-refresh) method to restore the cache. |
| ****VDS_E_OBJECT_DELETED****<br><br>0x8004240BL | The target object is no longer present. |

# WSCDeinstallProvider32 function

## Description

The **WSCDeinstallProvider32** function removes the specified 32-bit transport provider from the system configuration database.

**Note** This call enables a 64-bit process to manipulate the 32-bit Winsock catalog because [WSCDeinstallProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscdeinstallprovider), on 64-bit computers, only manipulates the native 64-bit Windows Sockets catalog.

## Parameters

### `lpProviderId` [in]

A pointer to a globally unique identifier (GUID) for the provider. This value is stored within each
[WSAProtocol_Info](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/winsock2/ns-winsock2-wsaprotocol_infoa) structure.

### `lpErrno` [out]

A pointer to the error code if the function fails.

## Return value

If no error occurs,
**WSCDeinstallProvider32** returns zero. Otherwise, it returns **SOCKET_ERROR**, and a specific error code is available in *lpErrno*.

| Error code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **[WSAEINVAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/windows-sockets-error-codes-2)** | The *lpProviderId* parameter does not specify a valid provider. |
| **[WSAEFAULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/windows-sockets-error-codes-2)** | The *lpErrno* parameter is not in a valid part of the user address space. |
| **[WSANO_RECOVERY](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/windows-sockets-error-codes-2)** | A nonrecoverable error occurred. This error is returned under several conditions including the following: the user lacks the administrative privileges required to write to the Windows Sockets registry, or a failure occurred when opening a catalog entry. |
| **[WSA_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinSock/windows-sockets-error-codes-2)** | Insufficient memory was available. This error is returned when there is insufficient memory to allocate a new catalog entry. |

## Remarks

**WSCDeinstallProvider32** is a strictly 32-bit version of [WSCDeinstallProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ws2spi/nf-ws2spi-wscdeinstallprovider). On a 64-bit computer, all calls not specifically 32-bit (for example, all functions that do not end in "32") operate on the native 64-bit catalog. Processes that execute on a 64-bit computer must use the specific 32-bit function calls to operate on a strictly 32-bit catalog and preserve compatibility. The definitions and semantics of the specific 32-bit calls are the same as their native counterparts.

The
**WSCDeinstallProvider32** function removes the common Windows Sockets 2 configuration information for the specified 32-bit provider. After this routine completes successfully, the configuration information stored in the registry will be changed. However, any Ws2_32.dll instances currently in memory will not be able to recognize this change.

On success, **WSCDeinstallProvider32** will attempt to alert all interested applications that have registered for notification of the change by calling [WSAProviderConfigChange](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaproviderconfigchange).

The **WSCDeinstallProvider32** function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If **WSCDeinstallProvider32** is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and **WSANO_RECOVERY** is returned in the *lpErrno* parameter.

For computers running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008, this function can also fail because of user account control (UAC). If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a **requestedExecutionLevel** set to **requireAdministrator**. If the application on Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.

The caller of this function must remove any additional files or service providerâ€“specific configuration information that is needed to completely uninstall the service provider.

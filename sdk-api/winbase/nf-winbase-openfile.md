# OpenFile function

## Description

Creates, opens, reopens, or deletes a file.

**Note** This function has limited capabilities and is not recommended. For new application development, use the
[CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function.

## Parameters

### `lpFileName` [in]

The name of the file.

The string must consist of characters from the 8-bit Windows character set. The
**OpenFile** function does not support Unicode file names or
opening named pipes.

### `lpReOpenBuff` [out]

A pointer to the [OFSTRUCT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-ofstruct) structure that receives
information about a file when it is first opened.

The structure can be used in subsequent calls to the
**OpenFile** function to see an open file.

The [OFSTRUCT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-ofstruct) structure contains a path string
member with a length that is limited to **OFS_MAXPATHNAME** characters, which is 128
characters. Because of this, you cannot use the **OpenFile**
function to open a file with a path length that exceeds 128 characters. The
[CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function does not have this path
length limitation.

### `uStyle` [in]

The action to be taken.

This parameter can be one or more of the following values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **OF_CANCEL**<br><br>0x00000800 | Ignored.<br><br>To produce a dialog box containing a **Cancel** button, use **OF_PROMPT**. |
| **OF_CREATE**<br><br>0x00001000 | Creates a new file.<br><br>If the file exists, it is truncated to zero (0) length. |
| **OF_DELETE**<br><br>0x00000200 | Deletes a file. |
| **OF_EXIST**<br><br>0x00004000 | Opens a file and then closes it.<br><br>Use this to test for the existence of a file. |
| **OF_PARSE**<br><br>0x00000100 | Fills the [OFSTRUCT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/ns-winbase-ofstruct) structure, but does not do anything else. |
| **OF_PROMPT**<br><br>0x00002000 | Displays a dialog box if a requested file does not exist.<br><br>A dialog box informs a user that the system cannot find a file, and it contains **Retry** and **Cancel** buttons. The **Cancel** button directs **OpenFile** to return a file-not-found error message. |
| **OF_READ**<br><br>0x00000000 | Opens a file for reading only. |
| **OF_READWRITE**<br><br>0x00000002 | Opens a file with read/write permissions. |
| **OF_REOPEN**<br><br>0x00008000 | Opens a file by using information in the reopen buffer. |
| **OF_SHARE_COMPAT**<br><br>0x00000000 | For MS-DOSâ€“based file systems, opens a file with compatibility mode, allows any process on a specified computer to open the file any number of times.<br><br>Other efforts to open a file with other sharing modes fail. This flag is mapped to the **FILE_SHARE_READ**|**FILE_SHARE_WRITE** flags of the [CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function. |
| **OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE**<br><br>0x00000040 | Opens a file without denying read or write access to other processes.<br><br>On MS-DOS-based file systems, if the file has been opened in compatibility mode by any other process, the function fails.<br><br>This flag is mapped to the **FILE_SHARE_READ**|**FILE_SHARE_WRITE** flags of the [CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function. |
| **OF_SHARE_DENY_READ**<br><br>0x00000030 | Opens a file and denies read access to other processes.<br><br>On MS-DOS-based file systems, if the file has been opened in compatibility mode, or for read access by any other process, the function fails.<br><br>This flag is mapped to the **FILE_SHARE_WRITE** flag of the [CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function. |
| **OF_SHARE_DENY_WRITE**<br><br>0x00000020 | Opens a file and denies write access to other processes.<br><br>On MS-DOS-based file systems, if a file has been opened in compatibility mode, or for write access by any other process, the function fails.<br><br>This flag is mapped to the **FILE_SHARE_READ** flag of the [CreateFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilea) function. |
| **OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE**<br><br>0x00000010 | Opens a file with exclusive mode, and denies both read/write access to other processes. If a file has been opened in any other mode for read/write access, even by the current process, the function fails. |
| **OF_VERIFY** | Verifies that the date and time of a file are the same as when it was opened previously.<br><br>This is useful as an extra check for read-only files. |
| **OF_WRITE**<br><br>0x00000001 | Opens a file for write access only. |

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the return value specifies a file handle to use when performing file I/O. To close the file, call the [CloseHandle](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/handleapi/nf-handleapi-closehandle) function using this handle.

If the function fails, the return value is **HFILE_ERROR**. To get extended error
information, call [GetLastError](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

## Remarks

If the *lpFileName* parameter specifies a file name and extension only, this function
searches for a matching file in the following directories and the order shown:

1. The directory where an application is loaded.
2. The current directory.
3. The Windows system directory.

   Use the [GetSystemDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getsystemdirectorya) function to get the
   path of this directory.
4. The 16-bit Windows system directory.

   There is not a function that retrieves the path of this directory, but it is searched.
5. The Windows directory.

   Use the [GetWindowsDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getwindowsdirectorya) function to get
   the path of this directory.
6. The directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable.

The *lpFileName* parameter cannot contain wildcard characters.

The **OpenFile** function does not support the
**OF_SEARCH** flag that the 16-bit Windows
**OpenFile** function supports. The
**OF_SEARCH** flag directs the system to search for a matching file even when a file name
includes a full path. Use the [SearchPath](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/processenv/nf-processenv-searchpathw) function to search
for a file.

A sharing violation occurs if an attempt is made to open a file or directory for deletion on a remote machine
when the value of the *uStyle* parameter is the **OF_DELETE** access
flag OR'ed with any other access flag, and the remote file or directory has not been opened with
**FILE_SHARE_DELETE** share access. To avoid the sharing violation in this scenario, open
the remote file or directory with **OF_DELETE** access only, or call
[DeleteFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-deletefilea) without first opening the file or directory for
deletion.

In Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, this function is supported by the following technologies.

| Technology | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| Server Message Block (SMB) 3.0 protocol | Yes |
| SMB 3.0 Transparent Failover (TFO) | Yes |
| SMB 3.0 with Scale-out File Shares (SO) | Yes |
| Cluster Shared Volume File System (CsvFS) | Yes |
| Resilient File System (ReFS) | Yes |

CsvFs will do redirected IO for compressed files.

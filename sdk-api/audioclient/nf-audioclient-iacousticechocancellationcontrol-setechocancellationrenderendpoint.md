## Description

Sets the audio render endpoint that should be used as the reference stream for acoustic echo cancellation (AEC).

## Parameters

### `endpointId`

The endpoint ID of the ender endpoint that should be used as the reference stream for AEC. Setting an invalid render device ID will fail with E_INVALIDARG. Setting the value to NULL will result in Windows using its own algorithm to pick the loopback reference device

## Return value

Returns an HRESULT value including the following:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| S_OK | Success. |
| E_INVALIDARG | The *endpointId* value is invalid. |

## Remarks

The following example illustrates the usage of **IAcousticEchoCancellationControl** interface. Call [IAudioClient::GetService](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/audioclient/nf-audioclient-iaudioclient-getservice), passing in the IID for the **IAcousticEchoCancellationControl** interface. If it succeeds, the capture endpoint supports control of the loopback reference endpoint for AEC. Note that an endpoint may support AEC, but may not support control of loopback reference endpoint for AEC. Call **SetEchoCancellationRenderEndpoint** to set the reference stream for AEC. If the call to **GetService** fails with **E_NOINTERFACE**, then the AEC effect on the endpoint (if supported), does not allow control over the loopback reference endpoint.

```cpp
wil::com_ptr_nothrow<IAudioClient> audioClient;

RETURN_IF_FAILED(device->Activate(_uuidof(IAudioClient), CLSCTX_INPROC_SERVER, nullptr, (void **)&audioClient));

// Call Initialize before calling GetService
// Implementation of IAudioClient::Initialize has been omitted from this sample for brevity.

RETURN_IF_FAILED(audioClient->Initialize(â€¦));

// If the capture endpoint supports acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), pass it the endpoint id of the
// audio render endpoint that should be used as the reference stream. If the capture endpoint does not
// support AEC, the GetService call fails with E_NOINTERFACE, so errors from GetService are not
// treated as fatal.

wil::com_ptr_nothrow<IAcousticEchoCancellationControl> audioAcousticEchoCancellationControl;

if (SUCCEEDED(audioClient->GetService(IID_PPV_ARGS(&audioAcousticEchoCancellationControl))))
{

RETURN_IF_FAILED(audioAcousticEchoCancellationControl-> SetEchoCancellationRenderEndpoint(endpointIdOfReferenceAudioStream));

}
```

# IChannelAudioVolume::SetAllVolumes

## Description

The **SetAllVolumes** method sets the individual volume levels for all the channels in the audio session.

## Parameters

### `dwCount` [in]

The number of elements in the *pfVolumes* array. This parameter must equal the number of channels in the stream format for the audio session. To get the number of channels, call the [IChannelAudioVolume::GetChannelCount](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/audioclient/nf-audioclient-ichannelaudiovolume-getchannelcount) method.

### `pfVolumes` [in]

Pointer to an array of volume levels for the channels in the audio session. The number of elements in the *pfVolumes* array is specified by the *dwCount* parameter. The caller writes the volume level for each channel to the array element whose index matches the channel number. If the stream format for the audio session has *N* channels, the channels are numbered from 0 to *N*â€“ 1. Valid volume levels are in the range 0.0 to 1.0.

### `EventContext` [in]

Pointer to the event-context GUID. If a call to this method generates a channel-volume-change event, the session manager sends notifications to all clients that have registered [IAudioSessionEvents](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/audiopolicy/nn-audiopolicy-iaudiosessionevents) interfaces with the session manager. The session manager includes the *EventContext* pointer value with each notification. Upon receiving a notification, a client can determine whether it or another client is the source of the event by inspecting the *EventContext* value. This scheme depends on the client selecting a value for this parameter that is unique among all clients in the session. If the caller supplies a **NULL** pointer for this parameter, the client's notification method receives a **NULL** context pointer.

## Return value

If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, possible return codes include, but are not limited to, the values shown in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | Parameter *dwCount* does not equal the number of channels in the stream format for the audio session, or the value of a *pfVolumes* array element is not in the range 0.0 to 1.0. |
| **E_POINTER** | Parameter *pfVolumes* is **NULL**. |
| **AUDCLNT_E_DEVICE_INVALIDATED** | The audio endpoint device has been unplugged, or the audio hardware or associated hardware resources have been reconfigured, disabled, removed, or otherwise made unavailable for use. |
| **AUDCLNT_E_SERVICE_NOT_RUNNING** | The Windows audio service is not running. |

## Remarks

This method, if it succeeds, generates a channel-volume-change event regardless of whether any of the new channel volume levels differ in value from the previous channel volume levels.

# PxeDhcpv6IsValid function

## Description

Validates that a packet is a valid DHCPv6 packet.

For more information about valid DHCPv6 packets, developers should refer to the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 ([RFC 3315](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3315.txt)) maintained by The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

## Parameters

### `pPacket` [in]

Pointer to a reply packet allocated with
the [PxePacketAllocate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wdspxe/nf-wdspxe-pxepacketallocate) function.

### `uPacketLen` [in]

Length of the packet pointed to by the *pPacket* parameter.

### `bRequestPacket` [in]

Indicates whether the packet is a request packet. The following table lists the possible values.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **TRUE**<br><br>1 | Packet to be validated is a request packet from the client. |
| **FALSE**<br><br>0 | Packet to be validated is a packet generated by the server. |

### `pbPxeOptionPresent` [out]

Address of a **BOOL** that is set to **TRUE** if the packet
is a valid DHCPv6 packet.

## Return value

If the function succeeds, the return value is **ERROR_SUCCESS**.

## Remarks

Providers use this function when the filter set with
the [PxeProviderSetAttribute](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wdspxe/nf-wdspxe-pxeprovidersetattribute) function is set to receive all
packets to determine if a specified packet is a valid DHCPv6 packet. Providers can also use this function to validate
reply packets; typically this is done only for debug or test builds of the provider.

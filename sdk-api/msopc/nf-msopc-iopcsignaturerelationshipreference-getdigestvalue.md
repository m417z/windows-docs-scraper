# IOpcSignatureRelationshipReference::GetDigestValue

## Description

Gets the digest value calculated for the selected relationships when they are signed.

## Parameters

### `digestValue` [out]

A pointer to a buffer that contains the digest value calculated using the specified digest method; the method is applied to the relationship markup of the selected relationships when they are signed.

### `count` [out]

The size of the *digestValue* buffer.

If the selected relationships have not been signed yet, *count* is 0.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **E_POINTER** | At least one of the *digestValue*, and *count* parameters is **NULL**. |

## Remarks

This method allocates memory used by the buffer returned in *digestValue*. If the method succeeds, call the [CoTaskMemFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree) function to free the memory.

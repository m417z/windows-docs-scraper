# DEV_BROADCAST_PORT_W structure

## Description

Contains information about a modem, serial, or parallel port.

## Members

### `dbcp_size`

The size of this structure, in bytes. This is the size of the members plus the actual length of the
**dbcp_name** string (the null character is accounted for by the declaration of
**dbcp_name** as a one-character array.)

### `dbcp_devicetype`

Set to **DBT_DEVTYP_PORT**.

### `dbcp_reserved`

Reserved; do not use.

### `dbcp_name`

A null-terminated string specifying the friendly name of the port or the device connected to the port.
Friendly names are intended to help the user quickly and accurately identify the deviceâ€”for example,
"COM1" and "Standard 28800 bps Modem" are considered friendly names.

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The dbt.h header defines DEV_BROADCAST_PORT as an alias that automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that is not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.

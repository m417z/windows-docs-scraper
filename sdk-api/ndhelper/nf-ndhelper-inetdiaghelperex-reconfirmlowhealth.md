# INetDiagHelperEx::ReconfirmLowHealth

## Description

The **ReconfirmLowHealth** method is used to add a second Low Health pass after hypotheses have been diagnosed and before repairs are retrieved. This method allows the helper class to see the diagnostics results and to change the diagnosis if needed. The method is only called if a diagnosis is not rejected and hypotheses were generated.

## Parameters

### `celt` [in]

The number of [HypothesisResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndhelper/ns-ndhelper-hypothesisresult) structures pointed to by *pResults*.

### `pResults` [in]

Pointer to [HypothesisResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndhelper/ns-ndhelper-hypothesisresult) structure(s) containing the [HYPOTHESIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndhelper/ns-ndhelper-hypothesis) information obtained via the [GetLowerHypotheses](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndhelper/nf-ndhelper-inetdiaghelper-getlowerhypotheses) method along with the status of that hypothesis. Includes one **HypothesisResult** structure for each hypothesis generated by the helper class's call to **GetLowerHypotheses**.

### `ppwszUpdatedDescription` [out]

An updated description of the incident being diagnosed.

### `pUpdatedStatus` [out]

A [DIAGNOSIS_STATUS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/ndhelper/ne-ndhelper-diagnosis_status) value which indicates the status of the incident.

## Return value

Possible return values include, but are not limited to, the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The operation succeeded. |

Any result other than S_OK will be interpreted as an error and will cause the function results to be discarded.

# IDWriteRenderingParams::GetClearTypeLevel

## Description

Gets the ClearType level of the rendering parameters object.

## Return value

Type: **FLOAT**

The ClearType level of the rendering parameters object.

## Remarks

The ClearType level represents the amount of ClearType â€“ that is, the degree to which the red, green, and blue subpixels of each pixel are treated differently. Valid values range from zero (meaning no ClearType, which is equivalent to grayscale anti-aliasing) to one (meaning full ClearType)

# ID3D12GraphicsCommandList1::OMSetDepthBounds

## Description

This method enables you to change the depth bounds dynamically.

## Parameters

### `Min` [in]

Type: **FLOAT**

[SAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values): `_In_`

Specifies the minimum depth bounds. The default value is 0. NaN values silently convert to 0.

### `Max` [in]

Type: **FLOAT**

[SAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/code-quality/annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values): `_In_`

Specifies the maximum depth bounds. The default value is 1. NaN values silently convert to 0.

## Remarks

Depth-bounds testing allows pixels and samples to be discarded if the currently-stored depth value is outside the range specified by *Min* and *Max*, inclusive. If the currently-stored depth value of the pixel or sample is inside this range, then the depth-bounds test passes and it is rendered; otherwise, the depth-bounds test fails and the pixel or sample is discarded. Note that the depth-bounds test considers the currently-stored depth value, not the depth value generated by the executing pixel shader.

To use depth-bounds testing, the application must use the new [CreatePipelineState](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device2-createpipelinestate) method to enable depth-bounds testing on the PSO and then can use this command list method to change the depth-bounds dynamically.

OMSetDepthBounds is an optional feature. Use the [CheckFeatureSupport](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/nf-d3d12-id3d12device-checkfeaturesupport) method to determine whether or not this feature is supported by the user-mode driver. Support for this feature is reported through the [D3D12_FEATURE_D3D12_OPTIONS2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/d3d12/ne-d3d12-d3d12_feature) structure.

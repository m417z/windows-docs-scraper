# D3D12_SUBOBJECT_TO_EXPORTS_ASSOCIATION structure

## Description

Associates a subobject defined directly in a state object with shader exports.

## Members

### `pSubobjectToAssociate`

Pointer to the subobject in current state object to define an association to.

### `NumExports`

Size of the *pExports* array. If 0, this is being explicitly defined as a default association. Another way to define a default association is to omit this subobject association for that subobject completely.

### `pExports`

The array of exports with which the subobject is associated.

## Remarks

Depending on the flags specified in the optional [D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_CONFIG](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_state_object_config) subobject for opting into cross linkage, the exports being associated donâ€™t necessarily have to be present in the current state object, or one that has been seen yet, to be resolved later, on raytracing pipeline state object (RTPSO) creation for example.

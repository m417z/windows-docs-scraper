## Members

### `DXILLibrary`

The library to include in the state object. Must have been compiled with library target 6.3 or higher.

### `NumExports`

The size of *pExports* array. If 0, everything gets exported from the library.

#### pExports

Optional exports array. For more information, see [D3D12_EXPORT_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d12/ns-d3d12-d3d12_export_desc).

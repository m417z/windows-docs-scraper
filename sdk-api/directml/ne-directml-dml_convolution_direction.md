## Description

Defines constants that specify a direction for the DirectML convolution operator (as described by the [DML_CONVOLUTION_OPERATOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_convolution_operator_desc) structure).

## Constants

### `DML_CONVOLUTION_DIRECTION_FORWARD`

Indicates a forward convolution.

### `DML_CONVOLUTION_DIRECTION_BACKWARD`

Indicates a backward convolution. Backward convolution is also known as *transposed* convolution.

  "description": "Performs an ROI align operation, as described in the [Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870) paper. In summary, the operation extracts cropped windows from the input image tensor, and resizes them to a common output size specified by the last 2 dimensions of *OutputTensor* using the specified *InterpolationMode*.",

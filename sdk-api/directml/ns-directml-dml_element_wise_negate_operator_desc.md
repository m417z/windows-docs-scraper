## Description

Negates each element of *InputTensor*, storing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = -x
```

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Remarks

## Availability
This operator was introduced in **DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_5_0**.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| InputTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT64, INT32, INT16, INT8 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | FLOAT32, FLOAT16, INT64, INT32, INT16, INT8 |

## Description

Rounds each element of *InputTensor* to an integer value, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

### `RoundingMode`

Type: **[DML_ROUNDING_MODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_rounding_mode)**

A [DML_ROUNDING_MODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ne-directml-dml_rounding_mode) determining the direction to round towards.

* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_HALVES_TO_NEAREST_EVEN**: values are rounded to the nearest integer, with halfway values (for example, 0.5) being rounded toward the nearest even integer.
* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_TOWARD_ZERO**: values are rounded toward zero. This effectively truncates the fractional part.
* If **DML_ROUNDING_MODE_TOWARD_INFINITY**: values are rounded to the nearest integer, with halfway values (for example, 0.5) being rounded away from zero (toward positive or negative infinity, depending on the sign of the value).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_1`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

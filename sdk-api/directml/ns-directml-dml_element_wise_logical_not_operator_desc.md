## Description

Performs a logical NOT on each element of *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = !x
```

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

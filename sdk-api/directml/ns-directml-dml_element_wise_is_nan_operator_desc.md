## Description

For each element of the input tensor, returns 1 if the input is NaN (as defined by IEEE-754), and 0 otherwise. The result is placed into the corresponding element of the output tensor.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Remarks

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_2_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount* and *Sizes*.

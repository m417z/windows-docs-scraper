## Description

Computes the bitwise population count (the number of bits set to 1) for each element of the input tensor, and writes the result into the output tensor.

The bitwise operation is applied to tensor data in its native encoding. Therefore, the tensor data type is ignored except for determining the width of each element.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Example

```
InputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT32)
[[0,   123], // 0b0000000000, 0b0001111011
 [456, 789]] // 0b0111001000, 0b1100010101

OutputTensor: (Sizes:{2,2}, DataType:UINT32)
[[0, 6],
 [4, 5]]
```

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DimensionCount* and *Sizes*.

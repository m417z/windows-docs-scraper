## Description

Computes the identity for each element of *InputTensor*, placing the result into the corresponding element of *OutputTensor*.

```
f(x) = x
```

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that *OutputTensor* is permitted to alias *InputTensor* during binding.

## Members

### `InputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The input tensor to read from.

### `OutputTensor`

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

### `ScaleBias`

Type: \_Maybenull\_ **const [DML_SCALE_BIAS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_scale_bias)\***

An optional scale and bias to apply to the input. If present, this has the effect of applying the function `g(x) = x * scale + bias` to each *input* element prior to computing this operator.

## Remarks
The identity operation is often used to copy a tensor.

It can also be used to transform the layout of tensors by manipulating strides (see [Using strides to express padding and memory layout](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/ai/directml/dml-strides)).

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_1_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*InputTensor* and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

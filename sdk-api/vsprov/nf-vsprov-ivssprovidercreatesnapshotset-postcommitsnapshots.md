# IVssProviderCreateSnapshotSet::PostCommitSnapshots

## Description

The **PostCommitSnapshots**
method is called after all providers involved in the shadow copy set have succeeded with
[CommitSnapshots](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vsprov/nf-vsprov-ivssprovidercreatesnapshotset-commitsnapshots).
The lock on the I/O system has been lifted, but the applications have not yet been unfrozen. This is an
opportunity for the provider to perform additional cleanup work after the shadow copy commit.

## Parameters

### `SnapshotSetId` [in]

The **VSS_ID** that identifies the shadow copy set.

### `lSnapshotsCount` [in]

Count of shadow copies in the shadow copy set.

## Return value

| Return code/value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ****S_OK****<br><br>0x00000000L | The operation was successfully completed. |
| ****E_OUTOFMEMORY****<br><br>0x8007000EL | Out of memory or other system resources. |
| **E_INVALIDARG**<br><br>0x80070057L | One of the parameter values is not valid. |
| ****VSS_E_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND****<br><br>0x80042308L | The *SnapshotSetId* parameter refers to an object that was not found. |
| ****VSS_E_PROVIDER_VETO****<br><br>0x80042306L | An unexpected provider error occurred. If this is returned, the error must be described in an entry in the application event log, giving the user information on how to resolve the problem. |

If any other value is returned, VSS will write an event to the event log and convert the error to
**VSS_E_UNEXPECTED_PROVIDER_ERROR**.

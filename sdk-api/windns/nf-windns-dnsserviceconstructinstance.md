## Return value

A pointer to a newly allocated [DNS_SERVICE_INSTANCE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windns/ns-windns-dns_service_instance) structure, built from the passed-in parameters. Your application is responsible for freeing the associated memory by calling [DnsServiceFreeInstance](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsservicefreeinstance).

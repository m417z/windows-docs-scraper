## Description

Values that identify the intended use of constant-buffer data.

> [!NOTE]
> For programming with Direct3D 10, this API has a type alias that begins `D3D10_` instead of `D3D_`. These Direct3D 10 type aliases are defined in `d3d10.h`, `d3d10misc.h`, and `d3d10shader.h`.

## Constants

### `D3D_CT_CBUFFER:0`

A buffer containing scalar constants.

### `D3D_CT_TBUFFER`

A buffer containing texture data.

### `D3D_CT_INTERFACE_POINTERS`

A buffer containing interface pointers.

### `D3D_CT_RESOURCE_BIND_INFO`

A buffer containing binding information.

### `D3D10_CT_CBUFFER`

A buffer containing scalar constants.

### `D3D10_CT_TBUFFER`

A buffer containing texture data.

### `D3D11_CT_CBUFFER`

A buffer containing scalar constants.

### `D3D11_CT_TBUFFER`

A buffer containing texture data.

### `D3D11_CT_INTERFACE_POINTERS`

## Remarks

This method returns the server response from a previous time-based seek.

**Note** This method normally cannot be invoked until some data
is read from the byte stream, because the [IMFByteStreamTimeSeek::TimeSeek](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/mfidl/nf-mfidl-imfbytestreamtimeseek-timeseek) method does not send a server request immediately.

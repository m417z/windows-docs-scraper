# MF_LEAKY_BUCKET_PAIR structure

## Description

Specifies the buffering requirements of a file.

## Members

### `dwBitrate`

Bit rate, in bits per second.

### `msBufferWindow`

Size of the buffer window, in milliseconds.

## Remarks

This structure describes the buffering requirements for content encoded at the bit rate specified in the **dwBitrate**. The **msBufferWindow** member indicates how much data should be buffered before starting playback. The size of the buffer in bytes is **msBufferWinow**Ã—**dwBitrate** / 8000.

All coordinates are in device independent pixels (DIPs).

## Members

### `glyphRun`

### `baselineOriginX`

X coordinate of the baseline origin for the layer.

### `baselineOriginY`

Y coordinate of the baseline origin for the layer.

### `runColor`

### `paletteIndex`

Zero-based index into the fontâ€™s color palette; if this is **0xFFFF**, the run should be drawn using the current brush.

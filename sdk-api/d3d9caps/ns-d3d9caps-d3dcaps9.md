| **D3DPRASTERCAPS_ZBUFFERLESSHSR** | Device can perform hidden-surface removal (HSR) without requiring the application to sort polygons and without requiring the allocation of a depth-buffer. This leaves more video memory for textures. The method used to perform HSR is hardware-dependent and is transparent to the application.<br><br>Z-bufferless HSR is performed if no depth-buffer surface is associated with the rendering-target surface and the depth-buffer comparison test is enabled (that is, when the state value associated with the [D3DRS_ZENABLE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3drenderstatetype) enumeration constant is set to **TRUE**). |

### `ShadeCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Shading operations capabilities. It is assumed, in general, that if a device supports a given command at all, it supports the D3DSHADE_FLAT mode (as specified in the [D3DSHADEMODE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dshademode) enumerated type). This flag specifies whether the driver can also support Gouraud shading and whether alpha color components are supported. When alpha components are not supported, the alpha value of colors generated is implicitly 255. This is the maximum possible alpha (that is, the alpha component is at full intensity).

The color, specular highlights, fog, and alpha interpolants of a triangle each have capability flags that an application can use to find out how they are implemented by the device driver.

This member can be one or more of the following flags.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **D3DPSHADECAPS_ALPHAGOURAUDBLEND** | Device can support an alpha component for Gouraud-blended transparency (the D3DSHADE_GOURAUD state for the D3DSHADEMODE enumerated type). In this mode, the alpha color component of a primitive is provided at vertices and interpolated across a face along with the other color components. |
| **D3DPSHADECAPS_COLORGOURAUDRGB** | Device can support colored Gouraud shading. In this mode, the per-vertex color components (red, green, and blue) are interpolated across a triangle face. |
| **D3DPSHADECAPS_FOGGOURAUD** | Device can support fog in the Gouraud shading mode. |

| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_CUBEMAP_POW2** | Device requires that cube texture maps have dimensions specified as powers of two. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_MIPCUBEMAP** | Device supports mipmapped cube textures. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_MIPMAP** | Device supports mipmapped textures. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_MIPVOLUMEMAP** | Device supports mipmapped volume textures. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL** | D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2 is also set, conditionally supports the use of 2D textures with dimensions that are not powers of two. A device that exposes this capability can use such a texture if all of the following requirements are met.<br><br>* The texture addressing mode for the texture stage is set to D3DTADDRESS_CLAMP.<br>* Texture wrapping for the texture stage is disabled ([D3DRS_WRAP](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3drenderstatetype) n set to 0).<br>* Mipmapping is not in use (use magnification filter only).<br>* Texture formats must not be [D3DFMT_DXT1](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dformat) through D3DFMT_DXT5.<br><br>If this flag is not set, and D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2 is also not set, then unconditional support is provided for 2D textures with dimensions that are not powers of two.<br><br>A texture that is not a power of two cannot be set at a stage that will be read based on a shader computation (such as the [bem - ps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/bem---ps) and [texm3x3 - ps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/texm3x3---ps) instructions in pixel shaders versions 1_0 to 1_3). For example, these textures can be used to store bumps that will be fed into texture reads, but not the environment maps that are used in [texbem - ps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/texbem---ps), [texbeml - ps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/texbeml---ps), and [texm3x3spec - ps](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/texm3x3spec---ps). This means that a texture with dimensions that are not powers of two cannot be addressed or sampled using texture coordinates computed within the shader. This type of operation is known as a dependent read and cannot be performed on these types of textures. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NOPROJECTEDBUMPENV** | Device does not support a projected bump-environment lookup operation in programmable and fixed function shaders. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_PERSPECTIVE** | Perspective correction texturing is supported. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_POW2** | If D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL is not set, all textures must have widths and heights specified as powers of two. This requirement does not apply to either cube textures or volume textures.<br><br>If D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL is also set, conditionally supports the use of 2D textures with dimensions that are not powers of two. See D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL description.<br><br>If this flag is not set, and D3DPTEXTURECAPS_NONPOW2CONDITIONAL is also not set, then unconditional support is provided for 2D textures with dimensions that are not powers of two. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_PROJECTED** | Supports the D3DTTFF_PROJECTED texture transformation flag. When applied, the device divides transformed texture coordinates by the last texture coordinate. If this capability is present, then the projective divide occurs per pixel. If this capability is not present, but the projective divide needs to occur anyway, then it is performed on a per-vertex basis by the Direct3D runtime. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_SQUAREONLY** | All textures must be square. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE** | Texture indices are not scaled by the texture size prior to interpolation. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_VOLUMEMAP** | Device supports volume textures. |
| **D3DPTEXTURECAPS_VOLUMEMAP_POW2** | Device requires that volume texture maps have dimensions specified as powers of two. |

### `TextureFilterCaps`

### `VolumeTextureFilterCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Texture-filtering capabilities for a volume texture. Per-stage filtering capabilities reflect which filtering modes are supported for texture stages when performing multiple-texture blending. This member can be any combination of the per-stage texture-filtering flags defined in [D3DPTFILTERCAPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dptfiltercaps).

### `TextureAddressCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Texture-addressing capabilities for texture objects. This member can be one or more of the following flags.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **D3DPTADDRESSCAPS_BORDER** | Device supports setting coordinates outside the range [0.0, 1.0] to the border color, as specified by the D3DSAMP_BORDERCOLOR texture-stage state. |
| **D3DPTADDRESSCAPS_CLAMP** | Device can clamp textures to addresses. |
| **D3DPTADDRESSCAPS_INDEPENDENTUV** | Device can separate the texture-addressing modes of the u and v coordinates of the texture. This ability corresponds to the D3DSAMP_ADDRESSU and D3DSAMP_ADDRESSV render-state values. |
| **D3DPTADDRESSCAPS_MIRROR** | Device can mirror textures to addresses. |
| **D3DPTADDRESSCAPS_MIRRORONCE** | Device can take the absolute value of the texture coordinate (thus, mirroring around 0) and then clamp to the maximum value. |

### `VolumeTextureAddressCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Texture-addressing capabilities for a volume texture. This member can be one or more of the flags defined for the TextureAddressCaps member.

### `LineCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Defines the capabilities for line-drawing primitives.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **D3DLINECAPS_ALPHACMP** | Supports alpha-test comparisons. |
| **D3DLINECAPS_ANTIALIAS** | Antialiased lines are supported. |
| **D3DLINECAPS_BLEND** | Supports source-blending. |
| **D3DLINECAPS_FOG** | Supports fog. |
| **D3DLINECAPS_TEXTURE** | Supports texture-mapping. |
| **D3DLINECAPS_ZTEST** | Supports z-buffer comparisons. |

### `MaxTextureWidth`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum texture width for this device.

### `MaxTextureHeight`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum texture height for this device.

### `MaxVolumeExtent`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum value for any of the three dimensions (width, height, and depth) of a volume texture.

### `MaxTextureRepeat`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

This number represents the maximum range of the integer bits of the post-normalized texture coordinates. A texture coordinate is stored as a 32-bit signed integer using 27 bits to store the integer part and 5 bits for the floating point fraction. The maximum integer index, 2Â²â·, is used to determine the maximum texture coordinate, depending on how the hardware does texture-coordinate scaling.

Some hardware reports the cap D3DPTEXTURECAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE. For this case, the device defers scaling texture coordinates by the texture size until after interpolation and application of the texture address mode, so the number of times a texture can be wrapped is given by the integer value in MaxTextureRepeat.

Less desirably, on some hardware D3DPTEXTURECAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE is not set and the device scales the texture coordinates by the texture size (using the highest level of detail) prior to interpolation. This limits the number of times a texture can be wrapped to MaxTextureRepeat / texture size.

For example, assume that MaxTextureRepeat is equal to 32k and the size of the texture is 4k. If the hardware sets D3DPTEXTURECAPS_TEXREPEATNOTSCALEDBYSIZE, then the number of times a texture can be wrapped is equal to MaxTextureRepeat, which is 32k in this example. Otherwise, the number of times a texture can be wrapped is equal to MaxTextureRepeat divided by texture size, which is 32k/4k in this example.

### `MaxTextureAspectRatio`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum texture aspect ratio supported by the hardware, typically a power of 2.

### `MaxAnisotropy`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum valid value for the D3DSAMP_MAXANISOTROPY texture-stage state.

### `MaxVertexW`

Type: **float**

Maximum W-based depth value that the device supports.

### `GuardBandLeft`

Type: **float**

Screen-space coordinate of the guard-band clipping region. Coordinates inside this rectangle but outside the viewport rectangle are automatically clipped.

### `GuardBandTop`

Type: **float**

Screen-space coordinate of the guard-band clipping region. Coordinates inside this rectangle but outside the viewport rectangle are automatically clipped.

### `GuardBandRight`

Type: **float**

Screen-space coordinate of the guard-band clipping region. Coordinates inside this rectangle but outside the viewport rectangle are automatically clipped.

### `GuardBandBottom`

Type: **float**

Screen-space coordinate of the guard-band clipping region. Coordinates inside this rectangle but outside the viewport rectangle are automatically clipped.

### `ExtentsAdjust`

Type: **float**

Number of pixels to adjust the extents rectangle outward to accommodate antialiasing kernels.

### `StencilCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Flags specifying supported stencil-buffer operations. Stencil operations are assumed to be valid for all three stencil-buffer operation render states (D3DRS_STENCILFAIL, D3DRS_STENCILPASS, and D3DRS_STENCILZFAIL).

For more information, see [D3DSTENCILCAPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dstencilcaps).

### `FVFCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Flexible vertex format capabilities.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **D3DFVFCAPS_DONOTSTRIPELEMENTS** | It is preferable that vertex elements not be stripped. That is, if the vertex format contains elements that are not used with the current render states, there is no need to regenerate the vertices. If this capability flag is not present, stripping extraneous elements from the vertex format provides better performance. |
| **D3DFVFCAPS_PSIZE** | Point size is determined by either the render state or the vertex data. If an FVF is used, point size can come from point size data in the vertex declaration. Otherwise, point size is determined by the render state D3DRS_POINTSIZE. If the application provides point size in both (the render state and the vertex declaration), the vertex data overrides the render-state data. |

### `MaxTextureBlendStages`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of texture-blending stages supported in the fixed function pipeline. This value is the number of blenders available. In the programmable pixel pipeline, this corresponds to the number of unique texture registers used by pixel shader instructions.

### `MaxSimultaneousTextures`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of textures that can be simultaneously bound to the fixed-function pipeline sampler stages. If the same texture is bound to two sampler stages, it counts as two textures.

This value has no meaning in the programmable pipeline where the number of sampler stages is determined by each pixel shader version. Each pixel shader version also determines the number of texture declaration instructions. See [Pixel Shaders](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3dhlsl/dx9-graphics-reference-asm-ps).

### `VertexProcessingCaps`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Vertex processing capabilities. For a given physical device, this capability might vary across Direct3D devices depending on the parameters supplied to [CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice). See [D3DVTXPCAPS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/direct3d9/d3dvtxpcaps).

### `MaxActiveLights`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of lights that can be active simultaneously. For a given physical device, this capability might vary across Direct3D devices depending on the parameters supplied to [CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice).

### `MaxUserClipPlanes`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of user-defined clipping planes supported. This member can be 0. For a given physical device, this capability may vary across Direct3D devices depending on the parameters supplied to [CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice).

### `MaxVertexBlendMatrices`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of matrices that this device can apply when performing multimatrix vertex blending. For a given physical device, this capability may vary across Direct3D devices depending on the parameters supplied to [CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice).

### `MaxVertexBlendMatrixIndex`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

DWORD value that specifies the maximum matrix index that can be indexed into using the per-vertex indices. The number of matrices is MaxVertexBlendMatrixIndex + 1, which is the size of the matrix palette. If normals are present in the vertex data that needs to be blended for lighting, then the number of matrices is half the number specified by this capability flag. If MaxVertexBlendMatrixIndex is set to zero, the driver does not support indexed vertex blending. If this value is not zero then the valid range of indices is zero through MaxVertexBlendMatrixIndex.

A zero value for MaxVertexBlendMatrixIndex indicates that the driver does not support indexed matrices.

When software vertex processing is used, 256 matrices could be used for indexed vertex blending, with or without normal blending.

For a given physical device, this capability may vary across Direct3D devices depending on the parameters supplied to [CreateDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3d9-createdevice).

### `MaxPrimitiveCount`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum number of primitives for each [DrawPrimitive](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-drawprimitive) call. There are two cases:

* If MaxPrimitiveCount is not equal to 0xffff, you can draw at most MaxPrimitiveCount primitives with each draw call.
* However, if MaxPrimitiveCount equals 0xffff, you can still draw at most MaxPrimitiveCount primitive, but you may also use no more than MaxPrimitiveCount unique vertices (since each primitive can potentially use three different vertices).

### `MaxVertexIndex`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Maximum size of indices supported for hardware vertex processing. It is possible to create 32-bit index buffers; however, you will not be able to render with the index buffer unless this value is greater than 0x0000FFFF.

Type: **float**

Maximum value of pixel shader arithmetic component. This value indicates the internal range of values supported for pixel color blending operations. Within the range that they report to, implementations must allow data to pass through pixel processing unmodified (unclamped). Normally, the value of this member is an absolute value. For example, a 1.0 indicates that the range is -1.0 to 1, and an 8.0 indicates that the range is -8.0 to 8.0. The value must be >= 1.0 for any hardware that supports pixel shaders.

### `DevCaps2`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

## Remarks

The MaxTextureBlendStages and MaxSimultaneousTextures members might seem similar, but they contain different information. The MaxTextureBlendStages member contains the total number of texture-blending stages supported by the current device, and the MaxSimultaneousTextures member describes how many of those stages can have textures bound to them by using the [SetTexture](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nf-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9-settexture) method.

When the driver fills this structure, it can set values for execute-buffer capabilities, even when the interface being used to retrieve the capabilities (such as [IDirect3DDevice9](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9helper/nn-d3d9helper-idirect3ddevice9)) does not support execute buffers.

In general, performance problems may occur if you use a texture and then modify it during a scene. Ensure that no texture used in the current [BeginScene](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-beginscene) and [EndScene](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-endscene) block is evicted unless absolutely necessary. In the case of extremely high texture usage within a scene, the results are undefined. This occurs when you modify a texture that you have used in the scene and there is no spare texture memory available. For such systems, the contents of the z-buffer become invalid at EndScene. Applications should not call [UpdateSurface](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/d3d9/nf-d3d9-idirect3ddevice9-updatesurface) to or from the back buffer on this type of hardware inside a BeginScene/EndScene pair. In addition, applications should not try to access the z-buffer if the D3DPRASTERCAPS_ZBUFFERLESSHSR capability flag is set. Finally, applications should not lock the back buffer or the z-buffer inside a BeginScene/EndScene pair.

The following flags concerning mipmapped textures are not supported in Direct3D 9.

* D3DPTFILTERCAPS_LINEAR
* D3DPTFILTERCAPS_LINEARMIPLINEAR
* D3DPTFILTERCAPS_LINEARMIPNEAREST
* D3DPTFILTERCAPS_MIPNEAREST
* D3DPTFILTERCAPS_NEAREST

# EapHostPeerMethodResult structure

## Description

The **EapHostPeerMethodResult** structure contains the result data generated by EAPHost during an authentication session that is then passed to an EAP method.

## Members

### `fIsSuccess`

If **TRUE**, the supplicant was successfully authenticated; if **FALSE**, it was not.

### `dwFailureReasonCode`

Contains a reason code if the supplicant could not be authenticated.

### `fSaveConnectionData`

If **TRUE**, the connection data specified in **pConnectionData** data must be persisted to disk; otherwise, it does not need to be saved.

### `dwSizeofConnectionData`

The size, in bytes, of **pConnectionData**.

### `pConnectionData.size_is`

### `pConnectionData.size_is.dwSizeofConnectionData`

### `pConnectionData`

A pointer to a byte buffer that contains information on the connection over which the EAP authentication session is held.

### `fSaveUserData`

If **TRUE**, the user data specified in **pUserData** data must be persisted to disk; otherwise, it does not need to be saved.

### `dwSizeofUserData`

The size, in bytes, of **pUserData**.

### `pUserData.size_is`

### `pUserData.size_is.dwSizeofUserData`

### `pUserData`

A pointer to a byte buffer that contains information on the supplicant user that requested the EAP authentication session.

### `pAttribArray`

Pointer to an [EAP_ATTRIBUTES](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/eaptypes/ns-eaptypes-eap_attributes) array structure that contains attributes of the authentication session.

### `isolationState`

An [ISOLATION_STATE](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/eaphostpeertypes/ne-eaphostpeertypes-isolation_state) link value that indicates the isolation state of the authentication session connection.

### `pEapMethodInfo`

A pointer to an [EAP_METHOD_INFO](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/eaptypes/ns-eaptypes-eap_method_info) structure that contains information about the EAP method that performed authentication for the supplicant.

### `pEapError`

A pointer to the [EAP_ERROR](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/eaptypes/ns-eaptypes-eap_error) structure that contains any errors raised by EAPHost during the execution of this function call. After consuming the error data, this memory must be freed by calling [EapHostPeerFreeEapError](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/api/eappapis/nf-eappapis-eaphostpeerfreeeaperror).

# AVIFileOpen function

## Description

The **AVIFileOpen** function opens an AVI file and returns the address of a file interface used to access it. The AVIFile library maintains a count of the number of times a file is opened, but not the number of times it was released. Use the [AVIFileRelease](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vfw/nf-vfw-avifilerelease) function to release the file and decrement the count.

## Parameters

### `ppfile`

Pointer to a buffer that receives the new [IAVIFile](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/vfw/nn-vfw-iavifile) interface pointer.

### `szFile`

Null-terminated string containing the name of the file to open.

### `uMode`

Access mode to use when opening the file. The default access mode is OF_READ. The following access modes can be specified with **AVIFileOpen**.

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| OF_CREATE | Creates a new file. If the file already exists, it is truncated to zero length. |
| OF_PARSE | Skips time-consuming operations, such as building an index. Set this flag if you want the function to return as quickly as possibleâ€”for example, if you are going to query the file properties but not read the file. |
| OF_READ | Opens the file for reading. |
| OF_READWRITE | Opens the file for reading and writing. |
| OF_SHARE_DENY_NONE | Opens the file nonexclusively. Other processes can open the file with read or write access. **AVIFileOpen** fails if another process has opened the file in compatibility mode. |
| OF_SHARE_DENY_READ | Opens the file nonexclusively. Other processes can open the file with write access. **AVIFileOpen** fails if another process has opened the file in compatibility mode or has read access to it. |
| OF_SHARE_DENY_WRITE | Opens the file nonexclusively. Other processes can open the file with read access. **AVIFileOpen** fails if another process has opened the file in compatibility mode or has write access to it. |
| OF_SHARE_EXCLUSIVE | Opens the file and denies other processes any access to it. **AVIFileOpen** fails if any other process has opened the file. |
| OF_WRITE | Opens the file for writing. |

### `lpHandler`

Pointer to a class identifier of the standard or custom handler you want to use. If the value is **NULL**, the system chooses a handler from the registry based on the file extension or the RIFF type specified in the file.

## Return value

Returns zero if successful or an error otherwise. Possible error values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **AVIERR_BADFORMAT** | The file couldn't be read, indicating a corrupt file or an unrecognized format. |
| **AVIERR_MEMORY** | The file could not be opened because of insufficient memory. |
| **AVIERR_FILEREAD** | A disk error occurred while reading the file. |
| **AVIERR_FILEOPEN** | A disk error occurred while opening the file. |
| **REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG** | According to the registry, the type of file specified in **AVIFileOpen** does not have a handler to process it. |

## Description

The POINTS structure defines the x- and y-coordinates of a point.

## Members

### `y`

Specifies the *y*-coordinate of the point.

### `x`

Specifies the *x*-coordinate of the point.

## Remarks

The POINTS structure is similar to the [POINT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-point) and [POINTL](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/windef/ns-windef-pointl) structures. The difference is that the members of the POINTS structure are of type SHORT, while those of the other two structures are of type LONG.

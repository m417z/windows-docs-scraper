# CF_UPDATE_FLAGS enumeration

## Description

Flags for updating a placeholder file or directory.

## Constants

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_NONE`

`0x00000000`

No update flags.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_VERIFY_IN_SYNC`

`0x00000001`

The update will fail if the **CF_UPDATE_FLAG_MARK_IN_SYNC** attribute is not currently set on the placeholder. This is to prevent a race between syncing changes from the cloud down to a local placeholder and the placeholderâ€™s data stream getting locally modified.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_MARK_IN_SYNC`

`0x00000002`

The platform marks the placeholder as in-sync upon a successful update placeholder operation.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_DEHYDRATE`

`0x00000004`

Applicable to files only. When specified, the platform dehydrates the file after updating the placeholder successfully. The caller must acquire an exclusive handle when specifying this flag or data corruptions can occur. Note that the platform does not validate the exclusiveness of the handle.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ENABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION`

`0x00000008`

Applicable to directories only. When specified, it marks the updated placeholder directory partially populated such that any future access to it will result in a FETCH_PLACEHOLDERS callback sent to the sync provider.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_DISABLE_ON_DEMAND_POPULATION`

`0x00000010`

Applicable to directories only. When specified, it marks the updated placeholder directory fully populated such that any future access to it will be handled by the platform without any callbacks to the sync provider.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_REMOVE_FILE_IDENTITY`

`0x00000020`

When specified, _FileIdentity_ and _FileIdentityLength_ in [CfUpdatePlaceholder](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/cfapi/nf-cfapi-cfupdateplaceholder) are ignored and the platform will remove the existing file identity blob on the placeholder upon a successful update call.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_CLEAR_IN_SYNC`

`0x00000040`

The platform marks the placeholder as not in-sync upon a successful update placeholder operation.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_REMOVE_PROPERTY`

`0x00000080`

The platform removes all existing extrinsic properties on the placeholder.

> [!NOTE]
> This value is available in Windows 10, version 1803 and later.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_PASSTHROUGH_FS_METADATA`

`0x00000100`

The platform passes **CF_FS_METADATA** to the file system without any filtering; otherwise, the platform skips setting any fields whose value is 0.

> [!NOTE]
> This value is available in Windows 10, version 1803 and later.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ALWAYS_FULL`

`0x00000200`

`CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ALWAYS_FULL` is effective on placeholder files only. When specified, the placeholder to be updated is marked always full. Once hydrated, any attempt to dehydrate such a placeholder file will fail with error code `ERROR_CLOUD_FILE_DEHYDRATION_DISALLOWED`.

### `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ALLOW_PARTIAL`

`0x00000400`

`CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ALLOW_PARTIAL` is effective on placeholder files only. When specified, the always full state on a placeholder file, if present, is cleared thus allowing it to be dehydrated again. It is invalid to specify this flag along with `CF_UPDATE_FLAG_ALWAYS_FULL` and error code `ERROR_CLOUD_FILE_INVALID_REQUEST` will be returned as a result.

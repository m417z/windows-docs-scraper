# IVssComponent::GetDifferencedFilesCount

## Description

The **GetDifferencedFilesCount**
method returns the number of file specifications in this component (and in any subcomponents of the

filesâ€”that is, backup and restores associated with it are to be implemented as if
entire files are copied to and from backup media (as opposed to using partial files).

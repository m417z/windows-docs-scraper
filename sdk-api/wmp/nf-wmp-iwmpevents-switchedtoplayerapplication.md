# IWMPEvents::SwitchedToPlayerApplication

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **SwitchedToPlayerApplication** event occurs when a remoted Windows Media Player control switches to the full mode of the Player.

## Remarks

This event occurs only when remoting the Windows Media Player control.

**Windows Media Player 10 Mobile:** This event is not supported.

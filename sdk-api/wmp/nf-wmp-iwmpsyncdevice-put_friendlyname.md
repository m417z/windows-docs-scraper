# IWMPSyncDevice::put_friendlyName

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **put_friendlyName** method specifies the user-defined name of the device.

## Parameters

### `bstrName` [in]

String containing the friendly name.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **NS_E_PDA_INITIALIZINGDEVICES (0xC00D118D)** | Windows Media Player is currently busy initializing devices. Please try again later. |

## Remarks

The friendly name is the string that is displayed in the Windows Media Player user interface to identify the device. For devices that support storing the friendly name on the device, this method also changes the friendly name on the device.

**Windows Media Player 10 Mobile:** This method is not supported.

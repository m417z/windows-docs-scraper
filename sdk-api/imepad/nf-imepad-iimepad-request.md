# IImePad::Request

## Description

Called by an [IImePadApplet](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imepad/nn-imepad-iimepadapplet) to insert text into an app.

**Request** is the only method that [IImePadApplet](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/imepad/nn-imepad-iimepadapplet) can call. By calling this method with one of the **IMEPADREQ_*** request IDs, **IImePadApplet** can insert text into an app and can control IME's composition string in an app.

## Parameters

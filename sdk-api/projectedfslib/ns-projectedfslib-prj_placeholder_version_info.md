# PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO structure

## Description

Information that uniquely identifies the contents of a placeholder file.

## Members

### `ProviderID`

A provider specific identifier.

### `ContentID`

A content identifier, generated by the provider.

## Remarks

A provider uses **PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO** to provide information that uniquely identifies the contents of a placeholder file. ProjFS stores the contents of this struct with the file and returns it when invoking callbacks.

**PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO**.ProviderID is a provider-specific identifier. The provider may use this value as its own unique identifier, for example as a version number for the format of the ContentID field.

**PRJ_PLACEHOLDER_VERSION_INFO**.ContentID is a content identifier, generated by the provider. This value is used to distinguish different versions of the same file, i.e. different file contents and/or metadata (e.g. timestamps) for the same file path.

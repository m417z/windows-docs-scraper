# EventWriteString function

## Description

Writes an ETW event that contains a string as its data. This function should not
be used.

## Parameters

### `RegHandle` [in]

Registration handle of the provider. The handle comes from
[EventRegister](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventregister). The
generated event will use the ProviderId associated with the handle.

### `Level` [in]

An 8-bit number used to describe an event's severity or importance.

> [!Important]
> ProviderId, Level and Keyword are the primary means for
> filtering events. Other kinds of filtering are possible but have much higher
> overhead. Always assign a nonzero level and keyword to every event.

See [EVENT_DESCRIPTOR](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventdatadesccreate) for details about the
event level.

### `Keyword` [in]

A 64-bit bitmask used to indicate an event's membership in a set of event
categories.

> [!Important]
> ProviderId, Level and Keyword are the primary means for
> filtering events. Other kinds of filtering are possible but have much higher
> overhead. Always assign a nonzero level and keyword to every event.

See [EVENT_DESCRIPTOR](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/evntprov/nf-evntprov-eventdatadesccreate) for details about the
event keyword.

### `String` [in]

NUL-terminated string to write as the event data.

## Return value

Returns **ERROR_SUCCESS** if successful or an error code. Possible error codes
include the following:

- **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER**: One or more of the parameters is not valid.
- **ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE**: The registration handle of the provider is not
valid.
- **ERROR_ARITHMETIC_OVERFLOW**: The event size is larger than the allowed
maximum (64KB - header).
- **ERROR_MORE_DATA**: The session buffer size is too small for the event.
- **ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY**: Occurs when filled buffers are trying to flush to
disk, but disk IOs are not happening fast enough. This happens when the disk
is slow and event traffic is heavy. Eventually, there are no more free (empty)
buffers and the event is dropped.
- **STATUS_LOG_FILE_FULL**: The real-time playback file is full. Events are not
logged to the session until a real-time consumer consumes the events from the
playback file.

The error code is primarily intended for use in debugging and diagnostic
scenarios. Most production code should continue to run and continue to report
events even if an ETW event could not be written, so release builds should
usually ignore the error code.

## Remarks

This API is not useful and should not be used.

- Most ETW analysis tools do not correctly support string-only events without a
manifest.
- Without a manifest, important information about the event (e.g. the provider
name, event id, and event name) are unavailable so the resulting events are
hard to use even when the analysis tool supports string-only events.
- With a manifest, this function behaves almost exactly like the code from a
manifest-based event with a single string field. However, the manifest-based
event is better-supported by trace analysis tools. In addition, the code
generated by [MC.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wes/message-compiler--mc-exe-) for an
event with a single string field is more efficient than the
  **EventWriteString** function.

Instead of using this API, consider the following alternatives:

- [Use TraceLoggingProvider.h](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/_tracelogging) to write events
that are well-supported by ETW analysis tools, work without a manifest, and
include metadata like provider name and event name.
- [Write an instrumentation manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wes/writing-an-instrumentation-manifest).
Create a simple event with a single NUL-terminated string value. You can write
and collect events even without a manifest. You will only need the manifest
for decoding the collected trace.

**EventWriteString** writes an event with a data payload consisting of the
specified string. This API is nearly equivalent to the following code:

```c
EVENT_DESCRIPTOR eventDescriptor;
EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR dataDescriptor;
EventDescCreate(&eventDescriptor, 0, 0, 0, Level, 0, 0, Keyword);
EventDataDescCreate(&dataDescriptor, String, (wcslen(String) + 1) * sizeof(WCHAR));
return EventWrite(RegHandle, &eventDescriptor, 1, &dataDescriptor);
```

The resulting event is the same as any other event generated by **EventWrite**
except that the resulting event has the **EVENT_HEADER_FLAG_STRING_ONLY** flag
set (see [EVENT_HEADER](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/evntcons/ns-evntcons-event_header)
for information about event flags).

Note that the event is written with ID, Version, Opcode, Task, and Channel set
to 0.

Note that the event uses the current thread's activity ID.

ETW analysis tools that are aware of the **EVENT_HEADER_FLAG_STRING_ONLY** flag
can extract the string value even when the decoder cannot locate any other
decoding information for the event provider. However, without a manifest, the
tools will not be able to determine the event's provider name.

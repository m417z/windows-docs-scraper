## Description

Interface for handling include directives. To customize the handling of include directives, you can provide an implementation of this interface.

To create a default implementation that reads include files from the filesystem, call [IDxcUtils::CreateDefaultIncludeHandler](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/dxcapi/nf-dxcapi-idxcutils-createdefaultincludehandler).

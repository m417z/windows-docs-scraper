# MsiSourceListClearMediaDiskA function

## Description

 The **MsiSourceListClearMediaDisk** function provides the ability to remove an existing registered disk under the media source for a product or patch in a specific context.

## Parameters

### `szProductCodeOrPatchCode` [in]

The [ProductCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/productcode) or patch GUID of the product or patch. Use a null-terminated string. If the string is longer than 39 characters, the function fails and returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. This parameter cannot be **NULL**.

### `szUserSid` [in, optional]

 This parameter can be a string SID that specifies the user account that contains the product or patch. The SID is not validated or resolved. An incorrect SID can return ERROR_UNKNOWN_PRODUCT or ERROR_UNKNOWN_PATCH.

| Type of SID | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| ****NULL**** | **NULL** denotes the currently logged on user. When referencing the current user account, *szUserSID* can be **NULL** and *dwContext* can be MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_USERMANAGED or MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_USERUNMANAGED. |
| **User SID** | Specifies enumeration for a particular user in the system. An example of user SID is "S-1-3-64-2415071341-1358098788-3127455600-2561". |

**Note** The special SID string s-1-5-18 (system) cannot be used to enumerate products or patches installed as per-machine. Setting the SID value to s-1-5-18 returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. When *dwContext* is set to MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_MACHINE only, *szUserSid* must be **NULL**.

**Note** The special SID string s-1-1-0 (everyone) should not be used. Setting the SID value to s-1-1-0 fails and returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAM.

### `dwContext` [in]

This parameter specifies the context of the product or patch instance. This parameter can contain one of the following values.

| Type of context | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_USERMANAGED** | The product or patch instance exists in the per-user-managed context. |
| **MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_USERUNMANAGED** | The product or patch instance exists in the per-user-unmanaged context. |
| **MSIINSTALLCONTEXT_MACHINE** | The product or patch instance exists in the per-machine context. |

### `dwOptions` [in]

The *dwOptions* value specifies the meaning of *szProductCodeOrPatchCode*.

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **MSICODE_PRODUCT** | *szProductCodeOrPatchCode* is a product code GUID. <br><br> |
| **MSICODE_PATCH** | *szProductCodeOrPatchCode* is a patch code GUID. |

### `dwDiskId` [in]

## Return value

The **MsiSourceListClearMediaDisk** function returns the following values.

| Value | Meaning |

## Remarks

Administrators can modify the installation of a product or patch instance that exists under the machine context or under their own per-user context (managed or unmanaged.) They can modify the installation of a product or patch instance that exists under any user's per-user-managed context. Administrators cannot modify another user's installation of a product or patch instance that exists under that other user's per-user-unmanaged context.

Non-administrators cannot modify the installation of a product or patch instance that exists under another user's per-user context (managed or unmanaged.) They can modify the installation of a product or patch instance that exists under their own per-user-unmanaged context. They can modify the installation of a product or patch instance under the machine context or their own per-user-managed context only if they are enabled to browse for a product or patch source. Users can be enabled to browse for sources by setting policy. For more information, see the [DisableBrowse](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/disablebrowse), [AllowLockdownBrowse](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/allowlockdownbrowse), and [AlwaysInstallElevated](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/alwaysinstallelevated) policies.

> [!NOTE]
> The msi.h header defines MsiSourceListClearMediaDisk as an alias that automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that is not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors.

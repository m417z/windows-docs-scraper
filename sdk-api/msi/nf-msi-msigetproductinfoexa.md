# MsiGetProductInfoExA function

## Description

The **MsiGetProductInfoEx** function returns product information for advertised and installed products. This function can retrieve information

 about an instance of a product that is installed under a user account other than the current user.

The calling process must have administrative privileges for a user who is different from the current user. The **MsiGetProductInfoEx** function cannot query an instance of a product that is advertised under a per-user-unmanaged context for a user account other than the current user.

This function is an extension of the [MsiGetProductInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msigetproductinfoa) function.

## Parameters

### `szProductCode` [in]

The [ProductCode](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/Msi/productcode) GUID of the product instance that is being queried.

### `szValue` [out, optional]

A pointer to a buffer that receives the property value. This buffer should be large enough to contain the information. If the buffer is too small, the function returns **ERROR_MORE_DATA** and sets **pcchValue* to the number of **TCHAR** in the value, not including the terminating NULL character.

If *lpValue* is set to **NULL** and *pcchValue* is set to a valid pointer, the function returns **ERROR_SUCCESS** and sets **pcchValue* to the number of **TCHAR** in the value, not including the terminating NULL character. The function can then be called again to retrieve the value, with *lpValue* buffer large enough to contain **pcchValue* + 1 characters.

If *lpValue* and *pcchValue* are both set to **NULL**, the function returns **ERROR_SUCCESS** if the value exists, without retrieving the value.

### `pcchValue` [in, out, optional]

A pointer to a variable that specifies the number of **TCHAR** in the *lpValue* buffer. When the function returns, this parameter is set to the size of the requested value whether or not the function copies the value into the specified buffer. The size is returned as the number of **TCHAR** in the requested value, not including the terminating null character.

This parameter can be set to **NULL** only if *lpValue* is also **NULL**. Otherwise, the function returns **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER**.

## Return value

The **MsiGetProductInfoEx** function returns the following values.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED** | The calling process must have administrative privileges to get information for a product installed for a user other than the current user. |
| **ERROR_BAD_CONFIGURATION** | The configuration data is corrupt. |
| **ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER** | An invalid parameter is passed to the function. |
| **ERROR_MORE_DATA** | A buffer is too small to hold the requested data. |
| **ERROR_SUCCESS** | The function completed successfully. |
| **ERROR_UNKNOWN_PRODUCT** | The product is unadvertised or uninstalled. |
| **ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROPERTY** | The property is unrecognized. <br><br>**Note** The [MsiGetProductInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msigetproductinfoa) function returns **ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROPERTY** if the application being queried is advertised and not installed. |
| **ERROR_FUNCTION_FAILED** | An unexpected internal failure. |

## Remarks

When the
**MsiGetProductInfoEx** function returns, the *pcchValue* parameter contains the length of the string that is stored in the buffer. The count returned does not include the terminating null character. If the buffer is not big enough,
**MsiGetProductInfoEx** returns **ERROR_MORE_DATA**, and
the *pcchValue* parameter contains the size of the string, in **TCHAR**, without counting the null character.

The **MsiGetProductInfoEx** function (**INSTALLPROPERTY_LOCALPACKAGE**) returns a path to the cached package. The cached package is for internal use only. Maintenance mode installations must be invoked through the
[MsiConfigureFeature](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiconfigurefeaturea),
[MsiConfigureProduct](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiconfigureproducta), or
[MsiConfigureProductEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msiconfigureproductexa) functions.

The [MsiGetProductInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/msi/nf-msi-msigetproductinfoa) function returns **ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROPERTY** if the application being queried is advertised and not installed. For example, if the application is advertised and not installed, a query for **INSTALLPROPERTY_INSTALLLOCATION** returns an error of **ERROR_UNKNOWN_PROPERTY**.

> [!NOTE]
> The msi.h header defines MsiGetProductInfoEx as an alias that automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that is not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).

# NVME_CONTROLLER_CAPABILITIES structure

## Description

Contains read only values that specify the basic capabilities of the controller to host software.

This structure is used in the Controller Capabilities (**CAP**) field of the [NVME_CONTROLLER_REGISTERS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_registers) structure.

## Members

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MQES`

Indicates the maximum individual queue size that the controller supports.

This value applies to each of the I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues that the host software creates.

This is a 0â€™s based value. The minimum value is `1h`, indicating two queue entries.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CQR`

Indicates whether I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues are required by the controller to be physically contiguous.

When this field is set to `1`, the controller requires that I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues are physically contiguous.
When this field is cleared to `0`, the controller supports I/O Submission Queues and I/O Completion Queues that are not physically contiguous.

When this field is set to `1`, the Physically Contiguous bit (the **PC** field) in the [Create I/O Submission Queue](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_cdw11_create_io_sq) and [Create I/O Completion Queue](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_cdw11_create_io_cq) commands is set to `1`.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.AMS_WeightedRoundRobinWithUrgent`

Indicates whether the Weighted Round Robin with Urgent Priority Class arbitration mechanism is supported by the controller.

When this field is set to `1`, the Weighted Round Robin with Urgent Priority Class arbitration mechanism is supported.

This **AMS_WeightedRoundRobinWithUrgent** and **AMS_VendorSpecific** fields indicate the optional arbitration mechanisms supported by the controller. The round robin arbitration mechanism is not listed since all controllers must support this arbitration mechanism.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.AMS_VendorSpecific`

Indicates whether the Vendor Specific arbitration mechanism is supported by the controller.

When this field is set to `1`, the Vendor Specific arbitration mechanism is supported.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Reserved0`

A reserved field (bits 19 to 23).

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.TO`

Indicates the worst case time that the host software will wait for the Ready (**RDY**) value in [Controller Status](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_status) to transition from:

- `0` to `1` after the **EN** value in [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration) transitions from `0` to `1`; or
- `1` to `0` after the **EN** value in [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration) transitions from `1` to `0`.

This worst case time may be experienced after events such as an abrupt shutdown or activation of a new firmware image. Typical times are expected to be much shorter.

The value of this field is in 500 millisecond units.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.DSTRD`

Indicates the *stride* between doorbell registers.

Each [Submission Queue](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_submission_queue_tail_doorbell) and [Completion Queue](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_completion_queue_head_doorbell) Doorbell register is 32-bits in size. The stride is specified as `(2 ^ (2 + DSTRD))` in bytes.

A value of `0h` indicates a stride of 4 bytes, where the doorbell registers are packed without reserved space between each register.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.NSSRS`

Indicates whether the controller supports the NVM Subsystem Reset feature defined in the [NVME_NVM_SUBSYSTEM_RESET](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_nvm_subsystem_reset) structure.

When this field is set to `1`, the controller supports the NVM Subsystem Reset feature.
hen this field is cleared to `0`, the controller does not support the NVM Subsystem Reset feature.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_NVM`

This field indicates whether the NVM Command Set is supported by the controller. A minimum of one command set must be supported.

When this field is set to `1`, the NVM Command Set is supported.

The **CSS_Reserved0** through **CSS_Reserved6** fields are reserved for other I/O Command Sets, if the value of one of these fields is set to `1`, then the corresponding I/O Command Set is supported.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved0`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved1`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved2`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved3`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved4`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved5`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.CSS_Reserved6`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Reserved2`

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MPSMIN`

Indicates the minimum host memory page size that the controller supports.

The minimum memory page size is `(2 ^ (12 + MPSMIN))`.

The host will not configure a memory page size in the **MPS** field of [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration) that is smaller than this value.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.MPSMAX`

Indicates the maximum host memory page size that the controller supports.

The maximum memory page size is `(2 ^ (12 + MPSMAX))`.

The host will not configure a memory page size in the **MPS** field of [NVME_CONTROLLER_CONFIGURATION](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/nvme/ns-nvme-nvme_controller_configuration) that is larger than this value.

### `DUMMYSTRUCTNAME.Reserved3`

### `AsUlonglong`

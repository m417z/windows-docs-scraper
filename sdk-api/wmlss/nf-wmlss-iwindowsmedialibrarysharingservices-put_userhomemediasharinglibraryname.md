# IWindowsMediaLibrarySharingServices::put_userHomeMediaSharingLibraryName

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Library Sharing Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/wmlss/windowsmedialibrarysharingservicesportal), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [Media Casting](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/media-casting). Media Casting has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use Media Casting instead of #FEATURENAMENOLINK#, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

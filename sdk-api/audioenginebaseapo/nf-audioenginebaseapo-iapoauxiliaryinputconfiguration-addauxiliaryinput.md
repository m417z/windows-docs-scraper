## Description

Adds an auxiliary input to the APO, and provides initialization parameters.

## Parameters

### `dwInputId`

Identifier for the input. This is a unique identifier generated by the system. The APO can use this identifier to differentiate between multiple auxiliary inputs.

### `cbDataSize`

The size of the initialization data, in bytes.

### `pbyData`

Initialization data specific to this APO.

### `pInputConnection`

Connection descriptor for this auxiliary input connection.

## Return value

HRESULT

| HRESULT | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| APOERR_NUM_CONNECTIONS_INVALID | The APO does not expect the auxiliary input. |

## Remarks

The initialization data is variable length and takes the following form. See [IAudioProcessingObject::Initialize](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/audioenginebaseapo/nf-audioenginebaseapo-iaudioprocessingobject-initialize) for information on using the initialization data.

```cpp
struct MyAPOInitializationData
{
    APOInitBaseStruct    APOInit;
    // add additional fields here...
};
```

This method will only be called only when the APO is not locked for processing. This method will not be called from a real-time processing thread.

# IDCompositionEffectGroup::SetOpacity(IDCompositionAnimation)

## Description

Animates the value of the Opacity property.

## Parameters

### `animation` [in]

Type: **[IDCompositionAnimation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dcompanimation/nn-dcompanimation-idcompositionanimation)***

An animation that represents how the value of the Opacity property changes over time. This parameter must not be NULL.

## Return value

Type: **[HRESULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

If the function succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise, it returns an **HRESULT** error code. See [DirectComposition Error Codes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/directcomp/directcomposition-error-codes) for a list of error codes.

## Remarks

This method makes a copy of the specified animation. If the object referenced by the *animation* parameter is changed after calling this method, the change does not affect the Opacity property unless this method is called again. If the Opacity property was previously animated, calling this method replaces the previous animation with the new animation.

This method fails if *animation* is an invalid pointer or if it was not created by the same [IDCompositionDevice](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/dcomp/nn-dcomp-idcompositiondevice) interface as the affected composition effect group. The interface cannot be a custom implementation; only interfaces created by Microsoft DirectComposition can be used with this method.

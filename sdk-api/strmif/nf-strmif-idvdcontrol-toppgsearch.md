# IDvdControl::TopPGSearch

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

**Note** The **IDvdControl** interface is deprecated. Use [IDvdControl2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-idvdcontrol2) instread.

Halts playback of the current program and restarts playback of the current program within the program chain (PGC).

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value .

## Remarks

A program is usually equivalent to a chapter, and a PGC is usually equivalent to a title. In the case of One_Sequential_PGC_Titles, each program is required to be a chapter and each title has only one PGC, but in other cases (especially with random/shuffle PGCs and parental blocks) there can be more than one program between chapters and there can be more than one PGC in a title.

This method returns an error unless the domain is DVD_DOMAIN_VideoManagerMenu, DVD_DOMAIN_VideoTitleSetMenu, or DVD_DOMAIN_Title. For more information, see [DVD_DOMAIN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ne-strmif-dvd_domain).

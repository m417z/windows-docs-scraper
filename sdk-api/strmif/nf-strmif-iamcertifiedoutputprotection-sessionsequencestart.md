# IAMCertifiedOutputProtection::SessionSequenceStart

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SessionSequenceStart` method initiates the COPP session with the graphics driver.

## Parameters

### `pSig` [in]

Pointer to an [AMCOPPSignature](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ns-strmif-amcoppsignature) structure. Fill this structure as described in the Remarks session.

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value. Possible values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **E_UNEXPECTED** | Invalid state. Possibly the application passed unexpected data, or called **IAMCertifiedOutputProtection** methods in the wrong order. |
| **VFW_E_NO_COPP_HW** | The display device does not support COPP; or the VMR has not connected to a display device yet. |

## Remarks

To fill in the structure for the *pSig* parameter, first concatenate the following numbers:

* The 128-bit number returned in the *pRandom* parameter of the [IAMCertifiedOutputProtection::KeyExchange](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iamcertifiedoutputprotection-keyexchange) method.
* Data integrity session key. This value is a 128-bit random number generated by the application.
* Starting sequence number for COPP status requests. This value is a 32-bit random number generated by the application.
* Starting sequence number for COPP commands. This value is a 32-bit random number generated by the application.

Then encrypt this number with 2048-bit RSA encryption using the graphics driver's public encryption key. The public encryption key is contained in the certificate returned in the *VarLenCertGH* parameter of the **KeyExchange** method.

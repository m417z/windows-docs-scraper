# IAMPushSource::SetStreamOffset

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SetStreamOffset` method sets the offset for time stamps generated by this filter.

## Parameters

### `rtOffset` [in]

New stream offset for the filter.

## Return value

Returns S_FALSE if the specified offset is larger than the filter's maximum preferred offset. Otherwise, returns S_OK if successful or an **HRESULT** value indicating the cause of the error.

## Remarks

The filter graph calls this method to adjust a filter's stream offset, in order to synchronize streams with different latency values.

If the return value is S_FALSE, the filter might not support a buffer large enough for the requested offset. Unless there is another buffer downstream, data might be lost. To retrieve the filter's maximum preferred offset, call the [IAMPushSource::GetMaxStreamOffset](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iampushsource-getmaxstreamoffset) method.

# IAMCertifiedOutputProtection::KeyExchange

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **KeyExchange** method returns the graphics driver's certificate.

## Parameters

### `pRandom` [out]

Receives a 128-bit random number, generated by the graphics driver. Use this value in the [IAMCertifiedOutputProtection::SessionSequenceStart](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-iamcertifiedoutputprotection-sessionsequencestart) method.

### `VarLenCertGH` [out]

Receives a pointer to a buffer containing the graphics driver's certificate. The method allocates the memory for the buffer. The caller must release the memory by calling [CoTaskMemFree](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/combaseapi/nf-combaseapi-cotaskmemfree).

### `pdwLengthCertGH` [out]

Receives the length of the buffer returned in *VarLenCertGH*.

## Return value

Returns an HRESULT value. Possible values include the following.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **E_UNEXPECTED** | Invalid state. Possibly the application passed unexpected data, or called [IAMCertifiedOutputProtection](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-iamcertifiedoutputprotection) methods in the wrong order. If this error occurs, the application should release the current instance of the VMR. |
| **VFW_E_NO_COPP_HW** | The display device does not support COPP; or the VMR has not connected to a display device yet. |
| **ERROR_GRAPHICS_NO_MONITORS_CORRESPOND_TO_DISPLAY_DEVICE** | No monitors correspond to the display device. This error can occur if the display mode changes; or the user turns off a monitor or removes a monitor. |

## Remarks

The graphics driver's certificate contains the driver's public encryption key.

If this method returns E_UNEXPECTED, the application should create a new COPP session by releasing the VMR, creating a new instance of the VMR, and calling `KeyExchange` again on the new instance.

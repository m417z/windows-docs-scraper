# IDvdControl2::SelectAudioStream

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SelectAudioStream` method selects the audio stream to play.

## Parameters

### `ulAudio` [in]

Value that specifies the audio stream. Valid stream numbers are 0 through 7, or **DVD_DEFAULT_AUDIO_STREAM** to specify the default stream.

### `dwFlags` [in]

Bitwise OR of one or more flags from the [DVD_CMD_FLAGS](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ne-strmif-dvd_cmd_flags) enumeration, specifying how to synchronize the command. This parameter is currently ignored; use DVD_CMD_FLAG_None.

### `ppCmd` [out]

Receives a pointer to an [IDvdCmd](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-idvdcmd) object that can be used to synchronize DVD commands. The caller must release the interface. This parameter can be **NULL**. For more information, see [Synchronizing DVD Commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/DirectShow/synchronizing-dvd-commands).

## Return value

Returns one of the following values.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_FALSE** | No default audio stream was found; or *dwFlags* is not zero. |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **E_INVALIDARG** | *ulAudio* is out of range, or doesn't correspond to an audio stream. |
| **E_UNEXPECTED** | The *ulAudio* value is valid, but the DVD Navigator could not set it for some reason. |
| **VFW_E_DVD_OPERATION_INHIBITED** | UOP control prohibits the operation. |
| **VFW_E_DVD_STREAM_DISABLED** | The specified stream is disabled. |

## Remarks

This method affects the audio of the current Video Title Set (VTS). When called from within a menu, this method sets the audio stream of the title from which the menu was called.

The following table shows the Annex J command name to which this method name corresponds, and the domains in which this method is valid.

# IAMExtTransport::put_Rate

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `put_Rate` method sets the playback rate for variable-speed external devices.

This method is not implemented.

## Parameters

### `dblRate` [in]

Specifies the rate as a multiple of normal playback rate. For example, 0.5 specifies half speed, and 2.0 specifies double speed.

## Return value

When this method succeeds, it returns S_OK. Otherwise it returns an **HRESULT** error code.

# IDvdInfo::GetCurrentSubpicture

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

**Note** The **IDvdInfo** interface is deprecated. Use [IDvdInfo2](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nn-strmif-idvdinfo2) instead.

Retrieves the number of available subpicture streams, the currently selected subpicture stream number, and whether the subpicture display is disabled.

## Parameters

### `pulStreamsAvailable` [out]

Pointer to the retrieved number of available subpicture streams.

### `pulCurrentStream` [out]

Pointer to the retrieved number of the currently selected subpicture stream.

### `pIsDisabled` [out]

Pointer to a value indicating whether the subpicture display is disabled.

## Return value

Returns an **HRESULT** value .

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **E_UNEXPECTED** | DVD is not initialized or domain is not DVD_DOMAIN_Title. |
| **S_OK** | Success. |
| **VFW_E_DVD_INVALIDDOMAIN** | Requested action is not supported on this domain ([DVD_DOMAIN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ne-strmif-dvd_domain)). |
| **VFW_E_DVD_OPERATION_INHIBITED** | Requested action cannot occur at this point in the movie due to the authoring of the current DVD-Video disc. |

## Remarks

Subpicture streams authored as forcedly activated streams will be displayed even if the application has disabled subpicture display with the [IDvdControl::SubpictureStreamChange](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/nf-strmif-idvdcontrol-subpicturestreamchange) method.

This method returns an error unless the domain is DVD_DOMAIN_Title. For more information, see [DVD_DOMAIN](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/strmif/ne-strmif-dvd_domain).

## Description

Calculates the length of the geometry as though each segment were unrolled into a line.

## Parameters

### `worldTransform`

Type: [in] **const [D2D1_MATRIX_3X2_F](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/Direct2D/d2d1-matrix-3x2-f) &**

The transform to apply to the geometry before calculating its length.

### `flatteningTolerance`

Type: [in] **FLOAT**

The maximum error allowed when constructing a polygonal approximation of the geometry. No point in the polygonal representation will diverge from the original geometry by more than the flattening tolerance. Smaller values produce more accurate results but cause slower execution.

### `length`

Type: [out] **FLOAT***

When this method returns, contains a pointer to the length of the geometry. For closed geometries, the length includes an implicit closing segment. You must allocate storage for this parameter.

## Return value

Type: **[HRESULT](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/com/structure-of-com-error-codes)**

If this method succeeds, it returns **S_OK**. Otherwise, it returns an [**HRESULT**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/com/structure-of-com-error-codes) error code.

# UpdateAssessment structure

## Description

[UpdateAssessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/updateassessmentstatus) contains information that assesses how up-to-date an installed OS is.

## Members

### `status`

An [UpdateAssessmentStatus](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/updateassessmentstatus) enumeration detailing how up-to-date the device is, and for what reason.

### `impact`

An  [UpdateImpactLevel](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/updateimpactlevel) enumeration detailing whether there is any impact on the device if it has an out-of-date OS.

### `daysOutOfDate`

Describes how much time has elapsed since the device has not installed an applicable update. **daysOutOfDate** is calculated by the current time minus the time since the next applicable update has been released, minus any deferral period. Thus, if an applicable update exists but hasnâ€™t been applied due to deferral, this is accounted for in the calculation. **daysOutOfDate** is used to calculate the update impact level.

## Remarks

This structure is used most often with [OSUpdateAssessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/waasapitypes/ns-waasapitypes-osupdateassessment), which is in turn used with the [GetOSUpdateAssessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/waasapi/nf-waasapi-iwaasassessor-getosupdateassessment) method for [IWaaSAssessor](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/waasapi/nn-waasapi-iwaasassessor).

When [GetOSUpdateAssessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/waasapi/nf-waasapi-iwaasassessor-getosupdateassessment) is called, an [OSUpdateAssessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/waasapitypes/ns-waasapitypes-osupdateassessment) structure is returned. Within this structure there are two **UpdateAssessment** structures: **assessmentForCurrent** and **assessmentForUpToDate**. The **UpdateAssessment** structure summarizes the assessments to determine whether a device is current or whether it is up-to-date, respectively; this is defined with the [UpdateAssessmentStatus](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/updateassessmentstatus) enumeration. The assessment informs how many days the device has been out-of-date with **daysOutofDate**. This date is used to determine if there is any potential impact (represented by the **impact** member in this structure) to the device.

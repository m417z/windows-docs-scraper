# TAPE_GET_DRIVE_PARAMETERS structure

## Description

The
**TAPE_GET_DRIVE_PARAMETERS** structure describes the tape drive. It is used by the [GetTapeParameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-gettapeparameters) function.

## Members

### `ECC`

If this member is **TRUE**, the device supports hardware error correction. Otherwise, it does not.

### `Compression`

If this member is **TRUE**, hardware data compression is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled.

### `DataPadding`

If this member is **TRUE**, data padding is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled. Data padding keeps the tape streaming at a constant speed.

### `ReportSetmarks`

If this member is **TRUE**, setmark reporting is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled.

### `DefaultBlockSize`

Device's default fixed block size, in bytes.

### `MaximumBlockSize`

Device's maximum block size, in bytes.

### `MinimumBlockSize`

Device's minimum block size, in bytes.

### `MaximumPartitionCount`

Maximum number of partitions that can be created on the device.

### `FeaturesLow`

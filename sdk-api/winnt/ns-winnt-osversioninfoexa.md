# OSVERSIONINFOEXA structure

## Description

Contains operating system version information. The information includes major and minor version
numbers, a build number, a platform identifier, and information about product suites and the latest Service Pack
installed on the system. This structure is used with the
[GetVersionEx](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getversionexa) and
[VerifyVersionInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-verifyversioninfoa) functions.

## Members

### `dwOSVersionInfoSize`

## Remarks

Relying on version information is not the best way to test for a feature. Instead, refer to the documentation
for the feature of interest. For more information on common techniques for feature detection, see
[Operating System Version](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/operating-system-version).

If you must require a particular operating system, be sure to use it as a minimum supported version, rather
than design the test for the one operating system. This way, your detection code will continue to work on future
versions of Windows.

The following table summarizes the values returned by supported versions of Windows. Use the information in the column labeled "Other" to distinguish between operating systems with identical version numbers.

| Operating system | Version number | **dwMajorVersion** | **dwMinorVersion** | Other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows 10 | 10.0* | 10 | 0 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType == VER_NT_WORKSTATION |
| Windows Server 2016 | 10.0* | 10 | 0 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType != VER_NT_WORKSTATION |
| Windows 8.1 | 6.3* | 6 | 3 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType == VER_NT_WORKSTATION |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | 6.3* | 6 | 3 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType != VER_NT_WORKSTATION |
| Windows 8 | 6.2 | 6 | 2 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType == VER_NT_WORKSTATION |
| Windows Server 2012 | 6.2 | 6 | 2 | OSVERSIONINFOEX.wProductType != VER_NT_WORKSTATION |

| Windows 2000 | 5.0 | 5 | 0 | Not applicable |
| ***** For applications that have been manifested for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Applications not manifested for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 will return the Windows 8 OS version value (6.2). To manifest your applications for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, refer to [Targeting your application for Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/targeting-your-application-at-windows-8-1). | | | | |

You should not rely upon only the **VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS** flag to determine
whether Small Business Server has been installed on the system, as both this flag and the
**VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS_RESTRICTED** flag are set when this product suite is installed. If
you upgrade this installation to Windows Server, Standard Edition, the
**VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS_RESTRICTED** flag will be clearedâ€”however, the
**VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS flag** will remain set. In this case, this indicates that Small
Business Server was once installed on this system. If this installation is further upgraded to Windows Server,
Enterprise Edition, the **VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS** flag will remain set.

If compatibility mode is in effect, the **OSVERSIONINFOEX** structure contains information about the operating system that is selected for [application compatibility](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/bb757005(v=msdn.10)).

To determine whether a Win32-based application is running on WOW64, call the
[IsWow64Process](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wow64apiset/nf-wow64apiset-iswow64process) function. To determine whether the system is running a 64-bit version of Windows, call the [GetNativeSystemInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getnativesysteminfo) function.

The [GetSystemMetrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getsystemmetrics) function provides the
following additional information about the current operating system.

| Product | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Server 2003 R2 | **SM_SERVERR2** |
| Windows XP Media Center Edition | **SM_MEDIACENTER** |
| Windows XP Starter Edition | **SM_STARTER** |
| Windows XP Tablet PC Edition | **SM_TABLETPC** |

#### Examples

For an example, see
[Getting the System Version](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/SysInfo/getting-the-system-version).

> [!NOTE]
> The winnt.h header defines OSVERSIONINFOEX as an alias that automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that is not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).

# IFullScreenVideoEx::SetClipFactor

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [DirectShow](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/directshow/directshow), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer), [IMFMediaEngine](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/mfmediaengine/nn-mfmediaengine-imfmediaengine), and [Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/medfound/audio-video-capture-in-media-foundation). Those features have been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer**, **IMFMediaEngine** and **Audio/Video Capture in Media Foundation** instead of **DirectShow**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The `SetClipFactor` method specifies the clip factor, which determines how much of the video the Full Screen Renderer is allowed to clip.

For example, suppose the display mode is 320 x 200 and the video is 352 x 288 pixels. Assuming the decoder cannot shrink the video, the display will clip about 25 percent of the image. The clip factor specifies the upper range that is permitted. The default value is 25%.

## Parameters

### `ClipFactor` [in]

Specifies the maximum allowable amount of the image to clip. The value is expressed as a percentage from 0 to 100.

## Return value

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| E_INVALIDARG | Invalid argument. |
| S_OK | Success. |

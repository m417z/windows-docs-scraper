# IWMPUserEventSink::NotifyUserEvent

## Description

\[The feature associated with this page, [Windows Media Player SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/wmp/windows-media-player-sdk), is a legacy feature. It has been superseded by [MediaPlayer](https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Media.Playback.MediaPlayer). **MediaPlayer** has been optimized for Windows 10 and Windows 11. Microsoft strongly recommends that new code use **MediaPlayer** instead of **Windows Media Player SDK**, when possible. Microsoft suggests that existing code that uses the legacy APIs be rewritten to use the new APIs if possible.\]

The **NotifyUserEvent** method notifies an application of an event generated by a custom video presenter that the application provided to the Enhanced Video Renderer (EVR).

## Parameters

### `EventCode` [in]

An event code that is meaningful only to the application and the custom video renderer. The event code must have a value greater than or equal to WMPUE_EC_USER, which is defined in wmpservices.h.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| S_OK | The method succeeded. |

## Remarks

An application that embeds the Windows Media Player control can provide a custom video renderer for the EVR by calling [IWMPVideoRenderConfig::put_presenterActivate](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wmprealestate/nf-wmprealestate-iwmpvideorenderconfig-put_presenteractivate). As the custom video renderer runs, it can notify the EVR of events by calling **IMediaEventSink::Notify**. If the event code supplied by the custom video renderer is greater than or equal to WMPUE_EC_USER, the EVR passes the event notification along to the application by calling **NotifyUserEvent**.

The definition of WMPUE_EC_USER depends on the definition of EC_USER, which is defined in evcode.h.

**Windows Media Player 10 Mobile:** This method is not supported.

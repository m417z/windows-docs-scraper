## Description

On input, specifies the size, in array elements, of the *pbPidListBuffer* array. On output, receives the number of PIDs.

### `pbPidListBuffer` [in, out]

Pointer to an array of [BDA_MUX_PIDLISTITEM](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/mstv/bda-mux-pidlistitem) structures. The method fills in the array with the list of PIDs.

## Return value

| ****S_OK**** | The method succeeded. |
| ****E_NOT_SUFFICIENT_BUFFER**** | The *pbPidListBuffer* array is too small. |

# IMFSample::GetSampleDuration

## Description

Retrieves the duration of the sample.

## Parameters

### `phnsSampleDuration` [out]

Receives the duration, in 100-nanosecond units.

## Return value

The method returns an **HRESULT**. Possible values include, but are not limited to, those in the following table.

| Return code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **S_OK** | The method succeeded. |
| **MF_E_NO_SAMPLE_DURATION** | The sample does not have a specified duration. |

## Remarks

If the sample contains more than one buffer, the duration includes the data from all of the buffers.

If the retrieved duration is zero, or if the method returns **MF_E_NO_SAMPLE_DURATION**, the duration is unknown. In that case, it might be possible to calculate the duration from the media typeâ€”for example, by using the video frame rate or the audio sampling rate.

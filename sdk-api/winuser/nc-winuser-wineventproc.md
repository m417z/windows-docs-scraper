# WINEVENTPROC callback function

## Description

An application-defined callback (or hook) function that the system calls in response to events generated by an accessible object. The hook function processes the event notifications as required. Clients install the hook function and request specific types of event notifications by calling [SetWinEventHook](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwineventhook).

The [WINEVENTPROC](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/dd373882(v=vs.85)) type defines a pointer to this callback function. *WinEventProc* is a placeholder for the application-defined function name.

## Parameters

### `hWinEventHook`

Type: **HWINEVENTHOOK**

Handle to an event hook function. This value is returned by [SetWinEventHook](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-setwineventhook) when the hook function is installed and is specific to each instance of the hook function.

### `event`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Specifies the event that occurred. This value is one of the [event constants](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinAuto/event-constants).

### `hwnd`

Type: **[HWND](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Handle to the window that generates the event, or **NULL** if no window is associated with the event. For example, the mouse pointer is not associated with a window.

### `idObject`

Type: **[LONG](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Identifies the object associated with the event. This is one of the [object identifiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinAuto/object-identifiers) or a custom object ID.

### `idChild`

Type: **[LONG](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Identifies whether the event was triggered by an object or a child element of the object. If this value is CHILDID_SELF, the event was triggered by the object; otherwise, this value is the child ID of the element that triggered the event.

### `idEventThread`

### `dwmsEventTime`

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Specifies the time, in milliseconds, that the event was generated.

#### - dwEventThread

Type: **[DWORD](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinProg/windows-data-types)**

Identifies the thread that generated the event, or the thread that owns the current window.

## Remarks

Within the hook function, the parameters *hwnd*, *idObject*, and *idChild* are used when calling [AccessibleObjectFromEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/oleacc/nf-oleacc-accessibleobjectfromevent).

Servers generate events by calling [NotifyWinEvent](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/winuser/nf-winuser-notifywinevent).

Create multiple callback functions to handle different events. For more information, see [Registering a Hook Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinAuto/registering-a-hook-function).

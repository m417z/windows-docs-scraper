# IControlChangeNotify::OnNotify

## Description

The **OnNotify** method notifies the client when the status of a connector or subunit changes.

## Parameters

### `dwSenderProcessId` [in]

The process ID of the client that changed the state of the control. If a notification is generated by a hardware event, this process ID will differ from the client's process ID. For more information, see Remarks.

### `pguidEventContext` [in]

A pointer to the context GUID for the control-change event. The client that initiates the control change supplies this GUID. For more information, see Remarks.

## Return value

If the method succeeds, it returns S_OK. If it fails, it returns an error code.

## Remarks

A client can use this method to keep track of control changes made by other processes and by the hardware. However, a client that changes a control setting can typically disregard the notification that the control change generates. In its implementation of the **OnNotify** method, a client can inspect the *dwSenderProcessId* and *pguidEventContext* parameters to discover whether it or another client is the source of the control-change event.

# FtpDeleteFileW function

## Description

Deletes a file stored on the FTP server.

## Parameters

### `hConnect` [in]

Handle returned by a previous call to
[InternetConnect](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetconnecta) using **INTERNET_SERVICE_FTP**.

### `lpszFileName` [in]

Pointer to a null-terminated string that contains the name of the file to be deleted.

## Return value

Returns **TRUE** if successful, or **FALSE** otherwise. To get a specific error message, call
[GetLastError](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/api/errhandlingapi/nf-errhandlingapi-getlasterror).

## Remarks

The
*lpszFileName* parameter can be either partially or fully qualified file names relative to the current directory.

Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects.

**Note** WinINet does not support server implementations. In addition, it should not be used from a service. For server implementations or services use [Microsoft Windows HTTP Services (WinHTTP)](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/WinHttp/winhttp-start-page).

> [!NOTE]
> The wininet.h header defines FtpDeleteFile as an alias that automatically selects the ANSI or Unicode version of this function based on the definition of the UNICODE preprocessor constant. Mixing usage of the encoding-neutral alias with code that is not encoding-neutral can lead to mismatches that result in compilation or runtime errors. For more information, see [Conventions for Function Prototypes](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/conventions-for-function-prototypes).

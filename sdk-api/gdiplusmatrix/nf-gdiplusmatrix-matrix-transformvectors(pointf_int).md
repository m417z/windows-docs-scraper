### Overload list

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [TransformVectors(Point*,INT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ms535318(v=vs.85)) | The [Matrix::TransformVectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ms535318(v=vs.85)) method multiplies each vector in an array by this matrix. The translation elements of this matrix (third row) are ignored. Each vector is treated as a row matrix. The multiplication is performed with the row matrix on the left and this matrix on the right. |
| [TransformVectors(PointF*,INT)](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ms535319(v=vs.85)) | The [Matrix::TransformVectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/ms535319(v=vs.85)) method multiplies each vector in an array by this matrix. The translation elements of this matrix (third row) are ignored. Each vector is treated as a row matrix.
